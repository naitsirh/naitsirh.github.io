<p class="calibre1">1. Another factor strongly attracting many loveshy men to the liberal arts is the opportunity to sit in classrooms populated mainly by young women. Several of my loveshy respondents advised me that they had found it "painfully depressing" and highly distracting to sit in a classroom composed exclusively or even primarily of fellow male students. Some of the loveshy men had dropped out of such technical, career-related majors as accounting, engineering, computer programming, etc., just in order to be able to take classes which might (they hoped) permit them to interact with women students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After graduating college all of these men had regretted such decisions. But equally sad is the fact that sitting in a lot of "liberal arts" classrooms proved quite insufficient to get the loveshy men actually interacting with any female students. Thus, the loveshy men would merely look and stare at the girls in their classes; they would not (because of severe shyness) actually interact with any of them. (As I have tried to clearly demonstrate in this chapter, introverted, inhibited college and university males belong in technical, career-related majors because they do not have the "chutz-pah" that is absolutely required for seeking <i class="calibre4"> or holding</i> a job as a liberal arts graduate.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p494"></a>Chapter 20</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Politics, Religion, and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The best one-word description for the loveshys' politics would be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"alienated". </i> As far as the loveshys were concerned, the existing political structure "couldn't care less" about them, and wouldn't be the least bit interested in helping them out in any way. Thus, the loveshys' attitude seemed to be: "Why should I give a damn?! As far as my life and well-being are concerned things will obviously remain the same no matter who gets into office! Nobody gives a damn about the plight of loveshy men!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">And on the basis of these feelings, it cannot be considered surprising that only 18 percent of the older loveshys and 23 percent of the younger ones had bothered to vote in the most recent general election.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, fully 62 percent of the non-shy men had voted in the most recent general election.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet most of the loveshys seemed to identify with quite liberal social and political viewpoints. During the past several years liberal politicians have become increasingly exasperated by the fact that truly liberal people are not particularly likely to either register or to vote. The older loveshy men represent as good an illustration of this point as one might be likely to find. For example, 96 percent of the older loveshys had favored George McGovern in the 1972 election. Yet only 15 percent of them had bothered to even register for the vote that year. (Those who had registered, however,  <i class="calibre4"> did</i> vote.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man a good many questions pertinent to social and political issues. Suffice it to say that the two loveshy groups came out significantly more liberal than the non-shy group, quite in spite of the youthful ages of the latter. Perhaps the non-shys saw themselves as having a vested interest in preserving the "status quo" inasmuch as the traditional ways of doing things had led them to become so happy and socially (and romantically) successful. Never having gotten very much 4 6 3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p495"></a>4 6 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the currently prevailing "system", it cannot be considered surprising that the loveshy men tended to be rather disenchanted with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In spite of their quite evident liberality, I found the loveshys to be rather strangely disinterested in the idea of identifying themselves with the Democratic Party. To be specific, fully 83 percent of the older loveshys and 64 percent of the younger loveshys identified themselves as being either "independents" or as just plain "uncommitted". In stark contrast, the non-shys were much more likely to identify themselves as being either Republicans or Democrats. Only 32 percent of the non-shy men saw themselves as being either "independent" or as "politically uncommitted"—quite despite their youthful ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Religion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the loveshys had become quite alienated from politics, they had similarly become alienated from conventional religious participation—</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably for much the same reasons: Conventional religious structures had never done anything to help them become involved with meaningful female companionship. Indeed, most of the loveshys tended to view conventional religious organizations as being rather sour on the idea of informal heterosexual interaction among unmarrieds—even though such interaction is a prerequisite in our society for marriage and parenthood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the religious factor is not a simple one. For example, only 4 percent of the older loveshys and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the younger ones considered themselves to be nonreligious, agnostic, or athiest. In contrast, fully 36 percent of the non-shy men regarded themselves as being nonreligious, agnostic or athiest; and this included several who occasionally attended conventional, organized church services! In essence, most loveshys appear to be religious. But their approach to religion is deeply personal and private. They view religiousness as a personal state of mind and prefer not to attend organized church services.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys had become alienated from religion by the militant overzealousness of fundamentalist Christians, some Roman Catholics, and other similar "born again" groups. This is not surprising given the strong tendency among the loveshy to feel uncomfortable around groups of people wherein there is any type of social pressure to conform either behaviorally or attitudinally. Loveshy men appear to have an unusually strong need to think for themselves, and to remove themselves from any situation wherein there is social pressure to conform to a certain thought style or behavioral mold. This explains their strong aversion to anything military in nature, to anything involving contact sports and athletics; and it seems to explain their aversion to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p496"></a>Politics, Religion, and the LoveShy  4 6 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized religion as well. The loveshy are not joiners; they have an inordinate fear of having their sense of identity swallowed up by any formal organization.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the loveshys had been alienated from organized religion by the disinterest and/or inability among the clergy to help them with their shyness problems. For example, some of the loveshys had written to clergymen of various mainstream denominations including Catholicism. And in their letters they had requested help in meeting potential female companions. The following interview segment can be considered typical of what usually happened in these cases:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I got the names and addresses of some Presbyterian ministers out of the Yellow Pages, and I wrote to them. One of the ministers was really nice, and he invited me to join his church, which I did.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be perfectly honest, I really didn't find anything wrong with any of the church services. They were quite nice. There wasn't any hell-fire and brimstone crap, and nobody tried to force any straight-laced religious dogma down my throat. The problem was that practically everybody who came to the church services every Sunday morning was either very old or very young. I mean it was basically a family service. There were a lot of children, and I used to enjoy listening to the children sing. It was really nice because the singing was never confined to the usual depressing hymn stuff. But I mean it was all family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the service there was usually a social hour. And there were almost no young women in their early 20s, which is what I was looking for. Like I said, they were all families along with a good number of elderly ladies as well. Now how the hell was that going to benefit me?! I liked the church because there didn't seem to be any fanatics associated with it. But after three or four months of attending the services I finally quit because I realized there was no way I was ever going to meet anybody there." (37-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In several cases the ministers had responded to the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">letters by inviting the loveshy man to join a weekly church therapy and prayer group. But again, the composition of these groups invariably lacked the presence of any young, never married women. These clergyman therapists and group facilitators had evidently been no less competent than the usual psychotherapists that are found in private practice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, they were perceived by most of the loveshy men as being warm, sincere, and well-intentioned. But with only married women, divorced people, alcoholics, elderly people, etc., attending the meetings, the loveshys tended to see little point in continued participation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paradoxically, the stricter, more fundamentalistic demoninations often do attract a large contingency of impressionable, insecure young</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p497"></a>4 6 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">women. But again, loveshy men inwardly rebel at the thought control and strong social pressures which prevail among the various fundamentalistic "bor</p>
<p class="calibre1">c</p>
<p class="calibre1">n again" sects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I strongly disagree with their belief that the Bible is the word of God and that it should be interpreted literally. But I went to a few of their meetings because I noticed that there were a lot of attractive girls my age there. I contacted the pastor by writing him a letter. I thought he might be able to get me introduced to someone. All that happened was that he interviewed me and invited me to come to a social event. When I arrived there I certainly wasn't disappointed by the attractiveness of the girls who were there. But the minister didn't actually do anything for me. I mean he came up to me and said he was delighted that I came. Then he introduced me to a guy, of all things. This guy he introduced me to was more interested in getting me to accept Jesus into my life than in getting me introduced to any of the women. I always believed in Christ anyway; but I just didn't like their attitude. I mean, it was as though only this guy really knew Christ and I didn't really know Him, and I wouldn't be saved unless I saw things their way. Actually, I didn't even have the nerve to tell the guy my real reason for being there. I thought the pastor might have told him; but I guess he didn't.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was also a lot of loud singing in unison—sort of like what fraternity men do at their beer brauls. I just didn't like the way my problem was totally ignored. And I especially didn't like the way I was forced to take part in these stupid group chants. I guess maybe it's just as well—because even if I had met a girl there I never would have been able to practice that kind of religion with her. I would have insisted that she come with me over to a more staid and sensible denomination. I know I would never be able to live with a woman who insisted on being a member of any of those crazy "born again"</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy seem to require a sort of "big brother" who will take them under their wing, and who will see to it that meaningful heterosexual interaction does take place and that it is actively and continuously facilitated. When such an unusually benign, highly altruistic "big brother"</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not provided, the loveshy often become anxiety-ridden and/or lose interest. For example, consider the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I grew up Catholic. And at various times I've written letters to the priests asking them if they could help me with my problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My parents have also contacted their bishop about my problem. And the thing is, nothing has ever come of all this. At home the bishop invited me to come to a young people's party. And the two different Catholic churches I contacted near the university campuses where I went to school—the same thing happened. They invited me to attend a young people's party. Well, I went to three of these. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p498"></a>Politics, Religion, and the LoveShy  4 6 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">only reason why I was able to go is because they had a layperson accompany me. There were no priests at all at any of these affairs, even though they were all held on church property. A layman took me inside all three different times. But once I was inside, everything was left entirely up to me. There were enough girls there. But I felt so anxiety-ridden that I escaped all three times after less than a half-hour of walking around the dance floor. I knew how to dance, but I just didn't have the nerve to approach anyone. And the church had not assigned anyone to get a girl for me. If they had assigned me to a girl, even if I didn't like her I would have stayed. But I would have to be assigned and put together with someone. There is no way I would ever have the nerve to do that for myself." (47-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would thus appear that the leaders of organized religion do have a viable potential for effectively helping the loveshy. However, as yet this viable potential has not even begun to be realized. Loveshy men enormously fear social ambiguity. They cannot "survive" within the context of an unstructured party situation. They must be engaged in highly structured social activities that entail and in fact <i class="calibre4"> require</i> direct face-to-face cooperation with eligible females. It is not sufficient for a clergyman to merely introduce a loveshy man to an eligible female. The loveshy man must be tactfully aided towards the end of becoming enmeshed in a conversation with the woman to whom he has been introduced. Those ministers who would be most helpful in this regard are going to be those who can get a loveshy man introduced to a fairly steady stream of new, eligible women, and who can directly foster the development of good, solid conversations with each.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men cannot be left alone in unstructured party situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They must be closely supervised and kept occupied with people. If this is not done they will escape either physically and/or in fantasy. Dependency is a prerequisite for any kind of socialization or therapeutic experience. Dependency is a temporary albeit indispensable stage through which all severely loveshy men must pass. Thus, clergymen and other therapeutic counselors need not feel uncomfortable about this need of the loveshy "to be taken by the hand". Once a loveshy man has gained a sufficient minimum amount of social self-confidence plus a suitable female companion, he will no longer display any need for being directly dependent upon someone for help.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Amenability to Religious Participation</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men appear to be quite disinclined towards joining <i class="calibre4"> anything. </i> Most of them appear to be <i class="calibre4"> particularly</i> disinclined towards joining (or even remaining near, for more than a few minutes) any group with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p499"></a>4 6 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">any semblance of zealous militancy, or any group which endeavors to standardize personalities and value systems through moralistic and/or militaristic intimidation and brainwashing. Loveshy men tend to associate any kind of zealousness and/or militancy with <i class="calibre4"> bullying. </i> And the loveshy sustain a deep loathing for any and all kinds of bullies, including those who might be operating in the service of what fundamentalists might construe to be Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the loveshy men I interviewed were quite aware of the matchmaking that goes on in many strict, conservative Christian churches. For example, devout young men of the Latter-Day Saint faith are expected by their church to devote two years to missionary work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But after their education and those two years of religious service have been completed, such young men are expected to begin thinking seriously about getting married. And those LDS men who remain into their late 20s without partners are quite commonly helped by church officials to obtain same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, very few of the loveshys I talked to had ever been tempted to join up with any strictly conservative religious organizations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of them felt that they could not compromise their integrity. And some of them disagreed so strongly with fundamentalist Christian viewpoints that there was no way they could seriously entertain the idea of even temporarily affiliating with any such organizations. To quote from one man:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll be damned if I'm going to become a bloody hypocrite about this thing. It wouldn't work out anyway because I know I could never live comfortably with someone whose views I disagreed with so strongly. How would we raise our children? I mean, how would we communicate about the things in life that are really important?! I've never been an athiest. And I wouldn't mind attending church again if the girl I married wanted to go. But it would have to be a moderate denomination with a minister who is either moderate or liberal. As far as I'm concerned, I feel just as uncomfortable around 'born again'</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christians as I do when I'm around athiests. There's got to be a happy medium. And I'm not going to become a hypocrite just to marry someone I could never see eye to eye with!" (22-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, it appears that most loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> might be</i> <i class="calibre4">amenable</i>— <i class="calibre4">if they were (figuratively speaking) taken by the hand</i>—to joining moderate-to-liberal mainstream churches such as Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Congregational, Disciples of Christ, Christian Science, Spiritualism, Religious Mind Science, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> However, in order to keep a loveshy man in the congregation, a minister or pastor is going to have to successfully accomplish three goals: (1) he must offer religious services</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p500"></a>Politics, Religion, and the LoveShy  4 6 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">and informal social get-togethers (with well-structured activities) that are attended by a large number of young, "single-never-married", attractive women; and (2) he is going to have to engineer a system for making introductions between the loveshy man and eligible girls. And thirdly (3) he is going to have to make sure that the loveshy man is comfortable after he makes each introduction, so that the loveshy man actually remains behind and talks with the girl. Clergyman readers who might be interested in helping the loveshy should carefully study Chapter 22</p>
<p class="calibre1">of this book which deals with <i class="calibre4"> "practice-dating therapy". </i> That material should serve as a source for potentially fruitful ideas. Actually there is no legal or practical reason as to why religious leaders could not become perfectly good practice-dating therapists!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A Rejoinder to Ponder</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Certain people never get tired of suggesting that a loveshy teenager or young adult might benefit from joining the Latter-Day Saint Church (Mormons). The LDS Church requires of its young men a great deal of assertive proselytizing activity. Usually two young men are sent out to work together on such endeavors. And this along with the prescribed missionary work (allegedly) has a tremendous impact upon building self-confidence, ego strength, and positive self-discipline.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now this viewpoint makes just about as much sense as a similar one which states that "going away to a university for four years will tremendously boost a loveshy boy's self-esteem and social self-confidence." In point of fact, the university experience <i class="calibre4"> does</i> boost a shy person's <i class="calibre4"> intellectual</i> self-image. But it does nothing by itself to remedy interpersonal self-confidence deficits vis-a-vis the opposite sex, or social tearfulness and inhibition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key finding of my research on loveshyness is that loveshy men are often quite self-confident in social situations <i class="calibre4"> where there is a script,</i> where there is a <i class="calibre4"> specific role</i> to play. On the other hand, in social situations that are <i class="calibre4"> purely informal, </i> where there is no purpose apart from pure, unadulterated sociability, the situation is <i class="calibre4"> far too ambiguous</i> for the loveshy man to function: and thus he <i class="calibre4"> "freezes", </i> or he escapes and runs away (either physically or, if he cannot do that, then <i class="calibre4"> in fantasy). </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The proselytizing and missionary roles in the LDS Church are both impersonal and highly structured, as is the role of university student in the classroom. Learning how to self-confidently get up and deliver a speech before an audience can confer a substantial amount of self-confidence upon a loveshy man. But unfortunately it WILL NOT be the <i class="calibre4"> sort</i> of self-confidence that will enable him to initiate friendly conversations with people or get himself a girlfriend/lover/wife. Simply put,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p501"></a>4 7 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-confidence in well-structured, impersonal, unambiguous situations where there is a definite script (role) to play WILL NOT CARRY OVER</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND CREATE SELF-CONFIDENCE IN UNSTRUCTURED SOCIAL SITUATIONS INVOLVING YOUNG WOMEN WHEREIN THERE IS NO</p>
<p class="calibre1">PURPOSE APART FROM PURE, UNADULTERATED SOCIABILITY</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND FRIENDLINESS!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, as a final note it must be added that LDS missionary work is all done on a strictly sex-segregated basis. It goes without saying that a sex-segregated environment is the very last thing that a loveshy man needs!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spiritualism</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the past twenty years I have been deeply interested and involved in the study of psychic and occult phenomena. For this reason I decided to throw in a small number of questionnaire items of pertinence to spiritualism and psi phenomena. In some respects the results I obtained were quite surprising. At the very least they provide some interesting clarification regarding the <i class="calibre4"> ways</i> in which some of the loveshy men are religious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I indicated earlier, to most loveshys religion is a very deeply personal and private matter. The following research findings provide some suggestions as to the way loveshy men think from a religious standpoint. And they highlight some of the ways whereby their "personal" religious thought may differ from that of the majority of people who are involved in conventional, mainstream religious participation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, 100 percent of the older loveshys together with 87 percent of the younger ones believe in "life after life". Surprisingly, only 50</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shy men expressed a belief in the concept of "life after life". Further, only 6 percent of the non-shy men indicated any belief in reincarnation. In contrast, fully 38 percent of the older loveshys and 31 percent of the younger loveshys indicated a belief in reincarnation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "Mind and brain are two different things; brain is just a temporary channel for the mind, and the two can exist completely apart from one another." The differences between the three respondent groups were quite substantial with regard to this issue. Only 35 percent of the non-shy men saw fit to agree with the statement. In stark contrast, fully 85 percent of the older loveshys and 73 percent of the younger loveshys registered agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p502"></a>Politics, Religion, and the LoveShy  4 7 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Related to the foregoing was the question: "Cases are frequently reported involving communication with and visitations from the discarnate spirits of deceased persons. Do you believe that some of these reports might be authentic and valid?" Fully 64 percent of the non-shy men indicated <i class="calibre4"> "no", </i> compared to just 37 percent of the older loveshys and 46 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The subject of out-of-the-body experiences has become increasingly popular of late. A person having an out-of-body experience genuinely believes that his/her sense of consciousness and sense of self have left the physical body. Out-of-body experiences are believed by many people to support the view that the real self or "soul" is something that is separate and apart from the physical vehicle. Fully 75 percent of the older loveshy men registered a belief in the concept of out-of-the-body experiences. The younger loveshys were second most believing with 63 percent endorsing the concept. On the other hand, only 43 percent of the non-shy men indicated a belief in out-of-the-body experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As for a basic belief in the reality of extra-sensory perception, the non-shy men were much more open-minded. Fully 79 percent of the non-shys accepted the reality of "ESP" as an established fact. The analogous figures for the two loveshy groups were 97 percent for the older ones and 89 percent for the younger ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lastly, I asked each man whether he accepted a basic principle of Spiritualism which holds that God exists within and throughout all of nature, including the minds of all human beings. Fully 93 percent of the older loveshys together with 87 percent of the younger ones indicated basic agreement with this viewpoint. I suspect that few of these agreeing respondents had much awareness of the implications of this principle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Be that as it may, just 42 percent of the non-shy men endorsed it as being valid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the loveshys appear to be quite a bit more "open" than the non-shys to an "other worldly" type of orientation and world view.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To some extent this may be a byproduct of the fact that <i class="calibre4"> this world</i> has not provided the loveshys with the range of rich satisfactions and experiences with which it has provided the non-shys. Long term deprivations have forced the loveshys to look in unusual directions for the possibility of satisfactions. And in hitting upon the psychic and occult, many of them felt privileged—as though they were in possession of a secret knowledge and awareness which the majority of people are "too dense"</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be able to share. In essence, the non-shy men were experiencing a sufficiently rich life right in the here and now; and many of them did not feel any special need for a higher spiritual world, or for personal immortality.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p503"></a>472</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, I am not making these statements in order to disparage a belief in Spiritualism or in psychic and occult subjects. Years of intense study have convinced me personally of the fundamental validity of many occult ideas. I am merely suggesting that people who feel driven from an early point in life to study Spiritualism and the occult have very often had to deal with a range of hardships and privations. Compared to others of their age and gender, they have not had as smooth or as easy a time in coping with life. In a 1975 monograph on the psychological correlates of a belief in psychic phenomena (by Notre Dame University priest and sociologist Andrew Greeley), a very similar conclusion was reached.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, a number of anthropologists have suggested that Spiritualism is the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> form of religious belief to have prevailed throughout 80 percent or more of all human societies down through history; and that the conventional American approach to religion is <i class="calibre4"> actually</i> the unusual one. Thus, conventional Christianity as practiced by most Americans appears to be a good deal more concerned with <i class="calibre4"> social control</i> than with satisfying man's truly spiritual needs. In essence, to many Americans religion operates primarily as a policeman and martinet, rather than as an agent offering true peace of mind, serenity, and a life purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why the term "God fearing" is used so much more often than the term "God loving".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In any event, the loveshy do not like to be <i class="calibre4"> "controlled" </i> or in any way bullied or harassed. This may be a key reason why the ideas of Spiritualism appeal to a good many of them so much more than does conventional, organized religious participation. Spiritualism provides for the satisfaction of spiritual needs <i class="calibre4"> without "controlling". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p504"></a>Chapter 21</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Movies, Music, and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people believe that it is possible to learn a great deal about a person from an analysis of his/her cultural tastes and interests. I shall confine my attention in this chapter to music and to motion pictures as the loveshy (especially the older ones) tended to have a great deal to say about both. Films and music appear to be very important in the lives of most loveshy men. Presumably this is because these media provide rich food for fantasy, along with a good deal of vicarious gratification.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First it is important to point out a curious paradox uncovered by my data. I had originally hypothesized that loveshyness would go hand in hand with the passive activity of seeing a great many motion pictures, and with the deriving of vicarious gratification from same. And indeed I <i class="calibre4"> did</i> find that the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshys tended to spend a substantially greater amount of time in motion picture theatres than the self-confident non-shys. However, what surprised me was that the <i class="calibre4"> younger</i> loveshys tended to see significantly <i class="calibre4"> fewer</i> motion pictures than either the older loveshys or the non-shys. In fact, the younger loveshys tended to be involved in a serious dearth of activities— <i class="calibre4">period! </i> And this lack of involvement tended to apply almost as much to such passive pursuits as film viewing as it did to active ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent how many motion pictures he had gone to the theatre to see during the four week period immediately preceding the interview. I stressed the fact with each respondent that I was only interested in motion pictures that he had seen in a theatre. I wanted to make certain that the respondent would not include anything that he might have seen on television.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the four week period prior to being interviewed, the older loveshy men had seen an average of 4.77 different films. The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was only 1.64 films. Curiously, the self-confident non-shy men had averaged 2.28 films in the four weeks prior to being interviewed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">473</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p505"></a>474 THERAPY  A N D PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, my interview data did strongly suggest that when the loveshy see a motion picture they really like they tend to pull out the stops. And this applies almost as much to the younger loveshys as it does to the older ones. Thus, loveshy men tend to go back to a theatre to view favorite pictures over and over and over again. Indeed, several of them boasted that they had sat through a film as many as five times in one sitting! A few of the loveshy men had seen certain films so very many times that one wonders how they could have possibly kept from becoming bored. Of course, as per the discussion in the chapter titled "LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind", loveshy men appear to be especially susceptible to very deep and unrelenting obsessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, loveshy men are especially prone to become obsessed with anything which they consider to be romantic and esthetically pleasing. They love motion pictures which incorporate well-structured, romantic love stories that tug at the heartstrings and which "grab a person" emotionally. Simply put, they love to be emotionally engrossed through the vicarious experiencing of love and romance, especially when the romance involves a girl whom they consider to be naturally beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys spoke of remaining transfixed in their movie chairs from 2 o'clock in the afternoon until midnight, just watching over and over again a film and/or female movie star of their obsessions and romantic preoccupations. For example, one 39-year old loveshy man had seen the 1973 film JEREMY 86 times, at least in part because he was so overwhelmed by the appearance of the star, Glynnis O'Connor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another 43 year old loveshy man had seen JEREMY 42 times, and then found a way to obtain a 16mm print of it through the underground.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he was earning a gross of only $9,000 per year at the time, he paid $1,000 cash for the JEREMY print. This, again, is ample testimony as to the powerful motivation provided by deep-seated obsessions with beautiful women and/or romantic stories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The film stars most often named by the loveshys as sources of deep-seated romantic obsessions and infatuations included the following: Glynnis O'Connor (JEREMY), Goldie Hawn (BUTTERFLIES ARE</p>
<p class="calibre1">FREE), Kathrine Ross (THE GRADUATE), Julie Biggs (NOBODY WAVED</p>
<p class="calibre1">GOODBYE), Brigitte Fossey (FORBIDDEN GAMES), Janet Margolin (DAVID AND LISA), Kay Lenz (BREEZY), Yvette Mimieux (TIME</p>
<p class="calibre1">MACHINE and JOY IN THE MORNING), Catherine Deneuve (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG), Mary Badham (TO KILL A MOCK-INGBIRD and THIS PROPERTY IS CONDEMNED), Carol Lynley (BLUE</p>
<p class="calibre1">DENIM), Hope Lange (PEYTON PLACE), Sondra Locke (THE HEART</p>
<p class="calibre1">IS A LONELY HUNTER), Isabelle Huppert (THE LACEMAKER), Anice Alvina (FRIENDS and PAUL AND MICHELE), Olivia Hussey (ROMEO</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND JULIET), Mary Steenburgen (TIME AFTER TIME and MELVIN</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p506"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy  4 7 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND HOWARD), Barbara Hershey (LAST SUMMER), Tuesday Weld (PRETTY POISON), and (quite interestingly) Jodie Foster (TOM SAWYER and THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVED DOWN THE LANE). Parenthetically, none of the loveshys mentioned TAXI DRIVER!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the loveshys' need to become deeply lost in the vicarious experiencing of romantic emotion must be considered perfectly understandable in view of both their backgrounds and their problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys had been quite totally lacking in the opportunity to experience emotion directly in their own lives. Virtually all of them seemed to suffer from what psychiatrists like to call "affect hunter". Indeed, by the loveshys' own admission, people often comment to them that they (the loveshys) seem to be incapable of expressing emotion because they are almost never observed laughing or displaying their feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys had commenced their obsessions with certain motion pictures while they were still quite young. One man saw the French language film FORBIDDEN GAMES fifteen times when he was only in the eighth grade. Eight of my respondents had seen DAVID</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND LISA in excess of a dozen times while they were still in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, many of their comments made it quite clear to me that a naturally beautiful female star is seldom sufficient to please a loveshy man, much less bring him back for a second viewing. For example, virtually all of the loveshys enthusiastically agreed that Bo Derek was one of the most beautiful women they had ever seen. Yet none of the loveshys who had seen the film "10" had liked it. Most of the loveshys had found it to be dreadfully boring because it contained an unstructured, highly confusing story with no love or romance. Simply put, it did not engross the emotions. It did not touch the heartstrings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, "10" was one of the comparatively few films which a small number of the self-confident non-shys had seen multiple times. The non-shys had loved it whereas the loveshys hated it—despite the fact that both groups agreed with the premise that Bo Derek is an extremely beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further example can be seen in the fact that BUTTERFLIES ARE</p>
<p class="calibre1">FREE was one of the loveshys' top favorite films of all time. Many loveshys had seen this film multiple times, and at least one man had seen it 24 times! Yet BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE was the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> Goldie Hawn film to be seen more than once by any loveshy man. In essence, her other films failed to deeply involve the emotions. Through the eyes of the loveshy, BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE was the only one that was not a mere "shallow comedy".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this sense, the romantic and emotionally engrossing character of a film's script may have more to do with the likelihood of a loveshy man developing a romantic infatuation with a film star than the issue</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p507"></a>4 7 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">of which actress plays the romantic role. One loveshy man had seen the original stage play of BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE with Blythe Danner in Ms. Hawn's role. And he claimed to have enjoyed Ms. Danner a good deal better than Ms. Hawn. Even at Broadway's steep ticket prices, he went back to see the stage version of BUTTERFLIES ARE FREE a total of six times!</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is nothing to be gained by discussing in detail all of the films which deeply fascinated each loveshy man who was interviewed for this study. However, I think it is appropriate to describe some of the films which precipitated deep and lasting obsessions in a significant fraction of the loveshy men who witnessed them. Again, I believe that it is possible to learn a good deal about the loveshy by studying films that deeply and thoroughly obsessed them over a substantial period of time. Further, a probing of the quality and flavor of these films can help to foster an understanding and an appreciation of the sort of male-female love relationships to which the loveshy aspire and which they tend to view as idyllic. Such a probing will also serve to highlight the sort of feminine pulchritude and vulnerable, nurturant attitude which enthralls the imagination of severely loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man interviewed to name every motion picture he could think of which he had seen <i class="calibre4"> "a minimum of at least five times." </i> Fully 87 percent of the older loveshys together with 69 percent of the younger loveshys named at least one such motion picture, as did 55 percent of the self-confident non-shy men. Most of the older loveshy men named at least seven such films, whereas the younger loveshys tended to name just two or three. The non-shy men tended to name just one or two films each; and the number of times they had seen each of the films they mentioned had seldom exceeded five or six.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Altogether, the 300 loveshy men named 63 motion pictures, whereas the non-shy men named only 20. The two lists which I have presented below represent a rank ordering of all the films mentioned as having been seen within a theatre five or more times. The figure in parentheses is the year the film was initially released. After year of initial release I have indicated the greatest number of times the motion picture had been viewed in a theatre <i class="calibre4"> by any one loveshy man. </i> Most of the first twenty films had been mentioned by at least six loveshy men. Films with the <i class="calibre4"> same number of times</i> indicated after year of release, were rank ordered according to the number of respondents who mentioned them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, five loveshy men had seen THE PARENT TRAP (#14) fifteen times whereas only three had seen FRIENDS (#15) fifteen times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, THE PARENT TRAP is ranked higher than FRIENDS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, I placed a line underneath the first seven films on both lists. Many analysts believe that a scrutinization of just the first seven</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p508"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy</p>
<p class="calibre1">477</p>
<p class="calibre1">films on each list can teach us more about key personality differences between the loveshy and the non-shy, than a more thorough coverage can. Others find it easier to make useful comparisons when the lists are kept comprehensive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The foregoing two lists suggest several key differences between the loveshy and the non-shy. First, the loveshy men named many more serious artistic works than did the non-shy men. This would tend to support the view that feminine beauty and esthetics are substantially more important to the loveshy than they are to the non-shy. Many of the films on the loveshys' list were "shoestring budget" films; indeed, Figure Five</p>

<p class="calibre1">four of the top ten had been filmed in black and white. And three of the top ten were foreign: #3 and #4 were French, and #10 was Canadian. (Altogether 6 of the 63 films were French.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The 63 films on the loveshys' list can be classified primarily into two categories: (1) "heavy", emotionally engrossing love stories, and (2) escapist musicals with a strong romantic flavor. In fact, even the science fiction items on the loveshys' list (#34 and #41) were preeminently love stories. Hence, this would appear to provide further testimony as to what the loveshys both want and actually most strongly need to have in their personal lives. It points up the thing of which they feel most severely deprived.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, a small number of items on their list appear somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">"out of place": particularly #12, #30, #39, and #46. However, even these films were tightly knit and emotionally engrossing compared to their counterparts on the non-shys' list. Of course, many of the loveshys sustain a strong interest in subjects pertaining to the occult and to Spiritualism; and most of them are politically and religiously liberal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, films on spiritual or political themes will evidently not appeal to the loveshy unless they are (1) emotionally gripping, and (2) intellectually accurate and credible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key feature of the non-shys' movie list is that all twenty of the films on it were enormously popular and made many millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p510"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy</p>
<p class="calibre1">479</p>
<p class="calibre1">And except for items #13 and 14, the material on the list can be sorted into essentially three categories: (1) escapist space fantasies, (2) raucous, slapstick comedy, and (3) blood, guts and gore. Moreover, none of the top seven films on the list contained any of the emotionally engrossing, romantic components which are of such enormous importance to the loveshy. Only 25 percent of the films on the non-shys' list could be said to contain reasonably strong, emotionally engrossing ingredients: #8,</p>
<p class="calibre1">#9, #13, #14, and #17.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since completing my research I have had the opportunity to show the non-shys' movie list to several severely loveshy older men. And whereas most of these people admitted that they did enjoy ONE FLEW</p>
<p class="calibre1">OVER THE COOCOO'S NEST, the SUPERMAN series, and to a moderate extent GONE WITH THE WIND, the majority of the non-shys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">favorite films had been painfully (and sometimes irritatingly) boring to the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have already commented on the film "10" (#5 on the non-shys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">list) which had starred Bo Derek. But far more irritating through the eyes of the loveshy were M*A*S*H and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Many of the loveshys to whom I talked were extremely amazed that these films could have done as well as they did inasmuch as both were "emotionally vacuous". To the loveshy, "2001" represented two hours of veritable nothingness apart from the lovely Johann Straus waltzes. (Some of the loveshys had gone to see this film only because Keir Dullea, the star of their enormously enjoyed DAVID AND LISA, was in it.) And M*A*S*H was viewed as being even more irritating because it was composed of two hours of plotless, ambiguous, unrelated skits that simply failed to "hang together", which were filmed in a military context (which loveshy men hate), and which were totally devoid of any semblance of romantic love and of feminine nurturance. The other space films listed by the non-shy men contained most of these same unappreciated attributes, although they were much less intensely disliked than "2001" and M*A*S*H.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The LoveShys' Prime Film Experiences</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For as far back as many of them could remember, motion pictures and the theatre had provided the loveshys with their only strongly positive emotional experiences. In contrast to the non-shys who were <i class="calibre4">living life, </i> the loveshy men had learned early in life to depend for their delights upon the vicarious experiencing of emotion. Most of them had begun getting "hooked" on films sometime between the ages of 10 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p511"></a>4 8 0 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">14. The following statement from a 42-year old loveshy man provides some idea as to how this happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Until I was about ten I was really bored with most of the stuff my parents took me to. On Saturday afternoons my parents occasionally made me go with the other kids to see these horrible westerns and war movies. I was just so bored; and I hated being with the roudy kids I was forced to go with. And most of the stuff my mother took me to was drama. And I guess I was really too young to understand it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But when I was about ten I remember we were visiting Florida. This was back in 1950, and my parents took me to see the film SHOW</p>
<p class="calibre1">BOAT. Well, I guess that's what really did it for me because I was enthralled. When I got home I went to see the film at least a dozen times, I was just so overwhelmed by the music and the romance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My parents just couldn't understand what fascinated me so much.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But they let me go. Movies were cheap in those days, and it was a chance for me to get out of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, after SHOW BOAT I began going to the movies more and more. I don't know. I guess it's a lot like Skinner's pigeons pecking away for nourishment. If you provide a highly rewarding experience every now and then, the pigeon will peck away forever. Well, most of the kids my age wanted to see crummy westerns and war movies; and I realized that I probably liked musicals best. So I started seeing a lot of them. And a lot of them like BRIGADOON and CAROUSEL</p>
<p class="calibre1">and THREE LITTLE WORDS and OKLAHOMA! really turned me on because they had a lot of beautiful music and love and romance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But sometimes I was disappointed, like with SINGING IN THE RAIN.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't like that one because it had no plot, and I couldn't understand it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I guess the real clincher came when I was in the eighth grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I read in the newspaper one day that there was a movie playing about a love relationship between a 6-year old girl and an 8-year old boy. My sense of excitement was immediately aroused because when I was 6 and 8 years old I was really in love with a girl in my class at school. But just like now, I didn't have the nerve to do anything about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, the name of the film was FORBIDDEN GAMES. And I didn't know it before I went into the theatre, but it was in the French language with subtitles. I had never seen any foreign language films before. And when I saw the subtitles I thought—Boy! I really threw my money away! But wow, was I wrong! I had entered the theatre at one in the afternoon; and I was so overwhelmed by the experience that I didn't leave the theatre until 11:30 that night. I didn't even think about food or anything. I just sat spellbound through it for five straight showings.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p512"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy  4 8 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, when I got home my parents both threw a fit. I remember they beat the hell out of me for staying out so late and not calling them. But I didn't care. I was just so in love with Brigitte Fossey, the six-year old girl in the film, that I just had to go back to the theatre as quickly as I possibly could. I was really hooked!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, during the next four months FORBIDDEN GAMES played at four different theatres in my area. And I went back to see it every chance I got, and I just stayed to see it at least three times each time I went. The theatre managers just couldn't understand me. And when I told some of the teachers at school about it, they were even more mystified! But I was really hooked, and deeply in love!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">FORBIDDEN GAMES dealt with a love relationship between a 6-year old girl and an 8-year old boy. The story chronicled what happened to the girl after both of her parents had been killed in the June 1940, Paris bombing. Thus, the little girl started wandering around and was eventually taken in by a poor farm family whose eight-year old son immediately fell in love with her. As children, some of the loveshys had had fantasies that their own parents might someday pick some little orphan girl off the street for them! So there was a great deal in this film to which the loveshys could relate. (Several of the loveshys had wanted their parents to get them a sister.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy in the film had the unusual hobby of stealing crosses from cemetaries, and using these crosses in his family's barn for the burial of dead mice and cockroaches. By the middle of the film the strong love interest between the young boy and girl had succeeded in distracting their respective preoccupations away from death and towards each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">DAVID AND LISA (film #2 on the loveshys' list) hooked many of the older loveshy men to films when they were attending college.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still others became fixated to this charming story of an intense love relationship between two teenagers resident in a home for emotionally disturbed adolescents when they themselves were only in high school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of the loveshys had first seen the film when they were only in the seventh grade, and several others had become hooked on it in the eighth and ninth grades. As had been the case for FORBIDDEN GAMES, many of these men had spent entire days in the theatre viewing this film over and over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In discussing why they liked DAVID AND LISA so much, several of the loveshys suggested that the film conveyed a powerful message which very few contemporary psychiatrists seem to have learned. The usual "wisdom" among practicing psychiatrists is that a person must lose his neurosis and become emotionally healthy <i class="calibre4"> BEFORE</i> he can be considered entitled to the loving companionship of a woman. Expressed another way, a person must love himself before he can really love others.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p513"></a>4 8 2 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The essential theme behind DAVID AND LISA, however, was to show how love itself (including all the compassionate communication of caring and concern that this entails) can serve as a powerful therapeutic <i class="calibre4"> (causative)</i> force in giving rise to the <i class="calibre4"> loss</i> of neurotic thought/behavior patterns, and to the movement towards emotional health, happiness <i class="calibre4"> and</i> self-love.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Expressed in more scientific terms,  <i class="calibre4"> love</i> (when it is mutual and reciprocal) is a powerful <i class="calibre4"> independent variable</i> (cause) giving rise to the <i class="calibre4">dependent variable</i> of emotional health and effectiveness. Thus, a key reason behind the feelings of exasperation which most loveshy men had felt regarding the psychiatrists who had treated them, was the implied assumption that "only after you get well can you have a girl; you're not entitled to one now". More succinctly, conventional psychiatry may be putting the cart <i class="calibre4"> before</i> the horse! Heterosexual love appears to be the most enormously powerful of all therapeutic forces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially intriguing is the fact that several of the loveshy men had fantasized for many years about having a girl all to themselves just like Janet Margolin, the girl who had portrayed Lisa in the film. Thus, even though Lisa was a victim of adolescent schizophrenia, many of the loveshy men would have liked nothing better than to have had her as a girl friend and wife! One reason why this fantasy may be noteworthy is that loveshy men are commonly viewed as being pathologically passive and dependent themselves. Yet the fantasies recounted to me about DAVID AND LISA suggest that many loveshy men would just love to have a really beautiful girl who nurtures their positive emotions, but who is totally dependent upon them for support and protection. Of course, as a schizophrenic Lisa was totally dependent. There was no way that she could have been expected to care for herself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was one motion picture that surpassed even FORBIDDEN GAMES and DAVID AND LISA in terms of leaving an indelible impact upon the loveshy and in terms of keeping many of them well furnished with intense memories that will last a lifetime. This film was JEREMY, a 1973 budget film about an intense love relationship between two New York City high schoolers. One man who had been living on food stamps because his graduate school education rendered him "overqualified" for every job for which he applied, spent $1,000 to illegally obtain a 16mm print of the film through the underground. Another man had seen the film 86 times—which is more times than any loveshy man studied for this book had seen any other film. Altogether, seventeen of the loveshys had seen the film 20 or more times; and most of the other loveshy respondents who had managed to see it at all had been sufficiently "fired up" by the experience to return to the theatre for multiple viewings.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p514"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy  4 8 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy in the film was depicted as being quite shy. But in spite of this he found a way to win the affection of his sweetheart through becoming an expert cellist. Despite the fact that the lovers in this film were high school students, the romance depicted was an intense and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"heavy" one. There were two catalysts which quite effectively served to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"hook" the loveshy on to this film: (1) the fact that the hero himself was depicted as being loveshy; and (2) the physical appearance of the heroine. The first of these factors made it exceedingly easy for the loveshy to immediately identify will all aspects of this film. And despite the fact that the starring actress was an unknown, her beauty served to effectively haunt the loveshy men to a far greater extent than did Olivia Hussey in ROMEO AND JULIET, or Ali McGraw in LOVE STORY and GOODBYE COLUMBUS.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jeremy's girl was portrayed by Glynnis O'Connor. And those interested in learning about what type of girl loveshy men would be especially desirous of winning would be well advised to study Ms. O'Connor's appearance and portrayal in this film. It was mentioned by no fewer than 25 of the loveshy men as representing the quintessence of perfection in feminine pulchritude and loving nurturance. Indeed, one man wistfully lamented that he would give up virtually anything and everything if he could somehow be supplied with an 18-year old clone of Ms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">O'Connor!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teenage love (including <i class="calibre4"> very young</i> teenage love) was a major theme among the films seen by the loveshys five or more times. In addition to JEREMY and DAVID AND LISA, other films in this category which received many mentions included NOBODY WAVED GOODBYE, FRIENDS, PAUL AND MICHELE, A LITTLE ROMANCE, PEYTON</p>
<p class="calibre1">PLACE (original 1957 version), BLUE DENIM, ROMEO AND JULIET, ICE CASTLES, OUR TIME, and WEST SIDE STORY. And, of course, many other films on the loveshys' list dealt with love relationships among the college aged. And FORBIDDEN GAMES dealt with love among prepubescent children, as did S*W*A*K. While it was too late for their being included on the loveshys' list, 1982 (after all the data for this book had been obtained) ushered in four new films of this genre which will doubtless enthrall thousands of contemporary loveshys: L'ADOLESCENT, VALLEY GIRL, PARADISE, and GREGORY'S GIRL.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in 1983 there was the Australian film LONELY HEARTS, and the American film JOHNNY BELINDA.</p>
<p class="calibre1">May-December romances constitute another theme which, for understandable reasons, enthralls many older loveshy men. The 1973</p>
<p class="calibre1">film BREEZY, with the late Bill Holden in the part of the older man, excited many of those interviewed. And the then 19-year old Kay Lenz,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p515"></a>4 8 4 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Holden's love interest in that picture, received many votes from the loveshys as "the perfect woman". Ms. Lenz's role in BREEZY depicted her as being wildly assertive, nurturant, and yet flamboyantly unconventional and nonconforming. These too are traits which are very rare in attractive young women; such traits seem to excite quite well the romantic fantasies of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another May-December romance worth mentioning here is contained in the Frank Loesser musical THE MOST HAPPY FELLA (1956).</p>
<p class="calibre1">As this was a live stage show and not a motion picture, it is not contained on the loveshys' list. However, it is noteworthy that a 44-year old loveshy man interviewed for this book claimed to have seen the show six times <i class="calibre4"> while he was still in high school! </i> Thus, it is almost as though pre-cognition had been operating here in that we have a person who had been deeply enthralled by a May-December romance (involving a very loveshy man) while he was still in high school!</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE MOST HAPPY FELLA was a serious work about a 60-year old, single-never-married grape farmer who became infatuated with a restaurant waitress during one of his trips to San Francisco. He is too shy to start a conversation with her, so he leaves her a love note along with an expensive piece of jewelry. The two correspond by mail over a period of several months. And at one point he sends her a photograph of his handsome young foreman, claiming that the picture is of himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lonely and in need of a loving man, the young girl travels to the old man's farm. And on the day of her arrival the lovelorn old man becomes so nervous and anxiety-ridden that he has a near-fatal accident in his truck as he heads for the railroad station to pick her up. Despite this, she comes to the farm, copulates with the handsome foreman, thinking that he is Tony, the 60-year old hero; and she swiftly becomes pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of the show the old man wins over and marries the young sweetheart, and accepts her baby as his own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the sort of story that inspires immediate identification in many loveshy men. And that is why they had wanted repeated exposures—although all two hours and fifteen minutes of THE MOST</p>
<p class="calibre1">HAPPY FELLA was commercially recorded; and it remains available in record stores to those interested. Parenthetically, the then 52-year old author-composer of THE MOST HAPPY FELLA, in 1956 married the 20-year old girl (Jo Sullivan) who played the heroine in THE MOST HAPPY</p>
<p class="calibre1">FELLA!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because it was filmed in black and white it is seldom seen anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the 1955 film MARTY remains one of the most "applicable to the loveshy" of any motion picture ever made. It depicts a 34-year old loveshy butcher who is anything but handsome, and who would very much like to have a wife. By the conclusion of this exceptionally engrossing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p516"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy  4 8 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">film by Paddy Chayefsky, he succeeded in getting one. However, the loveshy butcher (Marty, played by Ernest Borgnine) had had the advantage of being well integrated into (1) a caring Italian kinship network, and (2) an informal network of same-sexed peers. These are advantages which loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> in the real world</i> tend not to have. As I have indicated, such informal networks are exceedingly important in terms of helping people get introduced to eligible opposite sexed individuals. Nevertheless, MARTY was sufficiently enthralling to enough of the loveshy respondents to warrent place #7 on their list of all-time favorite films.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous musicals were included on the loveshys' list of most frequently viewed films. And many of the older loveshys interviewed in the New York and Los Angeles areas had enjoyed seeing a good many musicals performed live on stage. Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Jule Styne, Arthur Schwartz, George Gershwin, Jerry Herman, Steven Sondheim, and Harold Rome, appeared to be the composers most admired by the loveshy men. But Lerner and Loewe's BRIGADOON was the musical most often mentioned as being evocative of a never-ending supply of rich fantasy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, BRIGADOON was often mentioned in connection with two H. G. Wells movies, THE TIME MACHINE (1961) and TIME AFTER</p>
<p class="calibre1">TIME (1979), both of which were often mentioned among the films seen five or more times. Of course, the loveshys were far less likely than the non-shys to prefer science fiction related entertainment. Yet both THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">TIME MACHINE and TIME AFTER TIME <i class="calibre4"> are</i> science fiction. The crucial element that they have in common (and what distinguishes them from STAR WARS, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, STAR TREK, etc.) is that both are <i class="calibre4"> deeply romantic. </i> Moreover, both along with the musical BRIGADOON, ask the same poignant question which seems to thoroughly fascinate the loveshy. In essence, "Would you be willing to sacrifice <i class="calibre4">forever</i> everything you have in this world for the permanent, unconditional love and devotion of the heavenly beautiful girl of your dreams?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, LOST HORIZON asks this same question, although none of the respondents cited that work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of BRIGADOON, hero Tommy Albright stumbles upon an enchanted village amidst the mist and mountains of Scotland. The village becomes incarnate (materializes) for only one day every one hundred years. And, of course, during his day there he meets and falls in love with an enormously nurturant, exquisitely beautiful girl with the much preferred (among the loveshy) features of long, dark hair and pulchritudinous, oval face. In very short order Tommy has to decide whether to give up his home, family, friends and career back in America, for the eternal love and devotion of this beautiful girl. And, indeed, after briefly visiting the crass vulgarity of an airport bar he ends up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p517"></a>4 8 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">choosing the beautiful girl and remaining forever behind in BRIGADOON—much to the amazed dismay of his traveling companion Jeff Douglas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of H. G. Wells' THE TIME MACHINE, the hero travels forward thousands of years in his brilliant invention. And he meets a girl of heavenly, ethereal beauty, called Weena—played by Yvette Mimieux in the 1961 film, and by Mary Steenburgen in the 1979 version.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as in BRIGADOON, the hero opts to sacrifice everything for his beloved.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Music</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys in both age groups tended to prefer vocal love ballads, Broadway show music, brassy jazz music, easy listening, film soundtracks, and light classical works. A few of them mentioned having a strong liking for country and western. On the other hand, rock music of any kind tended to be strongly disliked by the loveshys. Their objections to it, however, were based on <i class="calibre4"> esthetic, </i> and not on moral grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, loveshy men prefer anything with rich and beautiful melody; and they dislike anything which is noisy, loud, dissonant, or unme-lodic. For most of the loveshys,  <i class="calibre4"> melody</i> appears to be the most important element in music. And in this regard many of their contemporaries would doubtless consider them to be "old fashioned". Thus, musical beat and lyrics matter a good deal <i class="calibre4"> less</i> to the loveshy than does melody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men prefer singers who by virtue of their talents can best bring out the melody. They prefer such artists as Steve Lawrence, Frank Sinatra, Robert Goulet, Sammy Davis, Jr., Gordon MacRae, Nat King Cole, Mario Lanza, Al Martino, Vic Damone, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Curiously, the loveshy mentioned very few female singers, although some of those that were mentioned include Barbra Streisand, Karen Carpenter, Julie Andrews, Barbara Cook, and Ethel Merman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, the non-shy men were heavily into "rock". In fact, most of the non-shys studied for this book seldom listened to anything other than what might be described as "hard rock". Several of them did mention that they also enjoyed country and western, rhythm and blues, and jazz. And a few voiced the cliched viewpoint that they "like all kinds of music". Upon scrutinizing the contents of their record collections, however, it became obvious that "rock" is pretty much the only sort of music for which they ever spend any money.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, there was one point of similarity between the musical tastes of the non-shy and the loveshy. Both groups tended to dislike classical music—although the loveshy indicated a liking for some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p518"></a>Movies, Music, and the LoveShy  4 8 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">"lighter" classical forms, such as certain of the more melodic works of Chopin, Tchaikovsky, Straus, Gregg, Borodin, Shubert, Offenbach, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, as seen by the loveshy, both "rock" and the "heavier" forms of classical music share an interesting common denominator: both suffer from a dearth or near total absence of melodic beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy perceive much of what is defined as classical music as being as "choppy" and dissonant as some of the worst "rock". Stra-vinsky's "Rite of Spring" illustrates a piece that is as dissonant and devoid of melodic beauty as anything that can be found in "rock". And many of Beethoven's symphonies are also quite choppy and lacking in melodic flow. All in all, most of the older loveshys would probably rate such composers as Rodgers, Kern, Loesser, Gershwin, Porter, Styne, Youmans, Straus, Schwartz, Romberg, Herbert, Loewe, Lane, etc., as having made more distinguished contributions to music than most of the so-called "classical" composers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Musical tastes might seem to be a "personal thing". However, most people aspire towards being able to <i class="calibre4"> share</i> the music they enjoy with other people. And the loveshy are no exception to this. The problem is that those in charge of running musical events and of financing record albums tend to think primarily in terms of the five "currently mainstream" musical tastes: (1) rock; (2) country and western; (3) classical; (4) rhythm and blues; and (5) gospel and religious. Very few loveshy men sustain an interest in <i class="calibre4"> any</i> of these areas. Record stores have come to be of little help. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, most record stores offered music for a wide range of different tastes. Today rock music dominates the space in most record stores; and what little is left over tends to be given over to country and western, and to classical.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This problem of imbalance (and of trying to force everyone into the same mold) is well reflected in the fact that such outstanding singers as Steve Lawrence, Tony Bennett, Al Martino, Robert Goulet, and even Frank Sinatra, find it very difficult to obtain the financial backing that is required for making albums. Choral groups such as Ray Charles Singers, Percy Faith Singers, etc., are not making albums at all anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And jazz music is similarly becoming increasingly difficult to find. Even Broadway show music has pretty well died off as a musical category inasmuch as rock music has taken over the dominant role in the Broadway theatre. Today new show albums are both created and sold almost exclusively by mail order through such organizations as those headed by Ben Bagley and Bruce Yeko. Aside from certain specialty record stores</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p519"></a>4 8 8 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">found only in London, New York and Los Angeles, such material simply isn't handled commercially anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy tend to be as "different" from the mainstream in their musical tastes as they are in a whole host of other ways. If the loveshy are to be helped, I would suggest that groups need to be formed in all major cities and on all university campuses, which <i class="calibre4"> respect</i> their tastes and interests, and which provide for the playing and enjoying of the types of music which they enjoy. Properly organized and managed, such groups could serve as a powerful catalyst for facilitating the initial meeting and the informal heterosexual interaction of loveshy people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these groups might specialize in jazz; others might specialize in traditional Broadway of the 1920s through 1960s; and still others might specialize in the more quiet varieties of easy listening and light classical music. Many loveshys strongly prefer the <i class="calibre4"> "intimate piano bar" </i> type of scenario (involving a skilled pianist and possibly a singer or two) wherein traditional show music is played.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the creation of such organizations, loveshy people could be encouraged to form groups and to both share and enhance their musical interests and knowledge within the sphere of the particular musical catagories to which they can best relate. Of course, loveshys are not "joiners". And this is why various kinds of catalysts are needed to facilitate their getting out of their apartments and involved in things.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the main concern of <i class="calibre4"> Part Three</i> of this book: <i class="calibre4"> "Therapy and Prevention". </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p521"></a>Anyone who truly believes that shyness is caused <i class="calibre4"> exclusively</i> by learning will <i class="calibre4"> NEVER</i> succeed at engineering a successful mode of therapy for the problem.

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p522"></a>Chapter 22</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Practice-Dating Therapy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So far in this book we have examined the causes and the consequences of severe and chronic loveshyness. Those who have read up to this point will surely agree that loveshyness can be an extremely debilitating and excruciatingly painful condition that entails formidable repercussions for the victim's ultimate stability, success and happiness in life. Fortunately, however, the situation is far from hopeless. Just within the past fifteen years a tremendous amount has been learned about ways of successfully treating and preventing loveshyness. And it is the purpose of this and the following chapter to examine the best and most promising of what has been learned up to now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At this time we already know a very great deal about ways of effectively preventing severe loveshyness from ever developing in the first place. But because there is quite a bit of resistance to the engineering of various modes of prevention, it appears likely that severe loveshyness will retain its current prevalence for quite some time into the future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why it is of the utmost importance for loveshyness victims to enjoy easy access to modes of therapeutic treatment that are as efficient, effective, and non-anxiety-provoking as possible. And of the approaches that have heretofore become available, make no mistake about it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">"practice-dating therapy" is the approach most applicable to the needs and psychoemotional characteristics of severely loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Behavior Therapy Approaches</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating is a form of <i class="calibre4"> behavior therapy. </i> All forms of behavior therapy are oriented towards the goal of successfully <i class="calibre4"> extinguishing</i> inappropriate anxieties and fears. Traditionally, this had entailed bringing the person face-to-face with the thing that he most strongly feared. There is obviously no way of successfully forcing an extremely nervous and inhibited man to approach and start a conversation with a girl who interests him. Yet conventional "shyness clinics" often assign this sort of thing as a "required homework exercise".</p>
<p class="calibre1">491</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p523"></a>492 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast majority of severely loveshy men will not cooperate in any exercise that arouses too much painful anxiety, or even the fear of experiencing painful anxiety. And by the way, this includes guided imaging. The vast majority of severely loveshy men find it far too anxiety-provoking to even <i class="calibre4"> visualize</i> themselves making a friendly overture vis-a-vis a girl. Inasmuch as it requires very little to painfully arouse the very low native anxiety threshold of a loveshy man, the task of engineering workable therapeutic programs has <i class="calibre4"> not</i> been an easy one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, my work with loveshy males has convinced me that almost all of them <i class="calibre4"> will cooperate</i> when someone else takes the responsibility of arranging introductions on their behalf. This is especially true if these arranged introductions are followed by a program of structured activities in which the loveshy man will not feel emotionally threatened in any way. In short, severely loveshy men will not cooperate with any type of therapeutic program that requires them to make the first move with a woman (in reality and/or in mental imagery), and which affords no structured system that would incorporate cushions against unexpected events causing anxiety attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite this, it might surprise some readers to learn that even severely loveshy males would in most cases willingly and even enthusiastically participate in a program that requires going out on therapist-arranged dates. Thus, I asked each loveshy man the following question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you participate in a form of therapy that in addition to involving many coeducational group discussions also <i class="calibre4"> required</i> you to go out on dates that were prearranged for you by the therapy team?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">The results for this question were heartening, and need to be carefully reflected upon by all those who aspire to engineer therapeutic programs that would help the severely loveshy. Specifically, 92 percent of the older loveshy men indicated <i class="calibre4"> "yes" </i> to this question, and <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the remaining 8 percent said <i class="calibre4"> "maybe". </i> The younger loveshys were slightly less enthusiastic. Yet even among the younger loveshys fully 83 percent said <i class="calibre4"> "yes" </i>—they <i class="calibre4"> would</i> participate in such a program—and another 12</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent indicated "maybe". Only 5 percent said "no", they would not be willing to participate in such a program.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further verification of the loveshys' psychoemotional ability and willingness to accept therapy involving arranged meetings with the opposite sex can be seen in the pattern of responses to the question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you enroll in a computer dating service?" Fully 87 percent of the older loveshys and 65 percent of the younger ones indicated <i class="calibre4"> "yes". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast, it is interesting to note that only 18 percent of the self-confident non-shys said "yes". Presumably this is because the non-shys experience little or no difficulty in meeting all the women they could possibly deal with.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p524"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 493</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several forms of practice-dating psychotherapy have been developed. All of these require the client to date and to informally interact with preselected opposite sexed age-mates. Thus, matches are arranged by a therapeutic staff. And it is the responsibility of each client (1) to go out on dates with the assigned individual, and (2) to attend weekly or twice-weekly 90-minute group sessions during which each young man and woman is accorded an opportunity to discuss anxieties, problems, difficulties, apprehensions, etc., and to participate in some structured exercises in psychodrama and role playing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating is based upon the <i class="calibre4"> extinction model</i> of behavior therapy. In practice-dating the irrational interpersonal anxieties associated with informal heterosexual interaction are "extinguished". This is accomplished through repeatedly exposing the loveshy man to the basic fear-producing stimuli—i.e., the opposite sex. This exposure is effected through engaging the loveshy client in a well-structured program of enjoyable and non-anxiety-provoking dating and conversational activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating <i class="calibre4"> does not</i> require its clients to jump into the deep end of the swimming pool before mastering the basic rudiments of successful functioning at the shallow end. Thus, practice-dating clients are not expected to initiate conversations with women whom they don't know—</p>
<p class="calibre1">until they have progressed to the point at which they have become personally ready to do this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating as a systematic mode of behavior therapy was developed at the University of Oregon during the early 1970s, by psychologists Hal Arkowitz and Andrew Christensen. Since that time, Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkowitz (now at the University of Arizona, Tucson) has taken the lead in publishing the greatest number of scholarly papers on this mode of therapy. However, numerous scholars and clinicians have become involved with it. Moreover, some credit for its development must also go to Dr. Joseph Melnick of Indiana University, who in 1973 published the first scholarly paper on practice-dating while Arkowitz and Christensen were still engrossed in the engineering of their seminal work in this area.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Practice-Dating" Model</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At this juncture I should like to present a composite sketch of the best and most essential features of practice-dating therapy. Much of the ongoing work pertinent to practice-dating remains exploratory in nature.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the heretofore published research results suggest that upwards of 95 percent of the most severely loveshy males can be sufficiently cured by this approach to permit normal participation in dating,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p525"></a>494 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtship and marriage. Simply put, practice-dating therapy is the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> <i class="calibre4">remedy</i> heretofore devised for dealing with loveshyness that <i class="calibre4"> really works</i> even on the most difficult and intractable cases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating is obviously not going to prove appropriate for dealing with all growth-stifling forms of shyness. But for shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex <i class="calibre4"> it really works! </i> And, of course, it is difficult to imagine a young man cured of his loveshyness who does not enormously benefit from the standpoint of social self-confidence gains in all other areas of his life. Once a young man is accorded the emotional freedom to love a woman, he is bound to gradually begin opening up in a wide variety of other types of social situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating therapy is conducted in groups composed of six men and six women. An exactly even gender ratio is absolutely mandatory in this form of therapy. In addition, the women clients must all be of the same age or younger than the male clients. Because loveshyness has always been a far more painful problem for men than for women, a significantly greater number of men than women usually sign up for it. And similarly, the women clients tend to drop out of therapy a good deal sooner than the men, either because a cure is effected for them sooner or because some of them lose interest or become disenchanted—something which virtually never happens for the men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This means that <i class="calibre4"> waiting lists</i> must be used for the male clients. I have found that time means something very different to the loveshy than it does to most people. For example, a year represents a long time to most Americans. To the loveshy it means next to nothing. If loveshyness entails no other virtue, it at least teaches patience—perhaps <i class="calibre4"> too</i> <i class="calibre4">much patience! </i> At any rate, each male desirous of practice-dating must wait for an opening. On large university campuses the wait required seldom need be more than a month or two. Large state university campuses will sometimes have as many as three 12-person groups operating simultaneously. This means that 18 men and 18 women can often be helped at any given point in time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most effective practice-dating programs incorporate two 90-minute group therapy sessions each week. Each of a group's twelve members is expected to attend these. Each meeting is led by one and sometimes two clinical psychologists. And occasionally one or two graduate students of clinical psychology will also be in attendance to help as facilitators. The therapy is conducted in an office that is large enough to comfortable accommodate the twelve clients and the therapeutic staff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Folding chairs are typically used; these are placed in a circle so that everybody is facing each other. Tables are not employed as these impede full vision. Each member of the group must be able to see the full body of every other member; and the seating is always boy-girl-boy-girl-boy-girl, etc., throughout the full circle.  <i class="calibre4"> Chairs are always used</i> in this form</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p526"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 495</p>
<p class="calibre1">of therapy. There is no sitting on the floor or sitting on pillows or cushions, as commonly obtains in nonprofessionally operated encounter groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before a client is accepted he or she must agree to the ground rules.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This agreement should be effected both formally and informally. Even when the therapy is being provided free of charge as on university campuses, each group member should be expected to sign a written contract, thus committing himself/herself to all necessary rules and policies. At the same time, the therapeutic staff must approach their clients with a confident, positive mental attitude. Their attitude should be that this is an approach which <i class="calibre4"> will work successfully</i> for all who follow the rules.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of weeks during which each practice-dating group will meet will vary quite considerably. Normally shy university students of both sexes typically reach the point where they can date on their own after only about ten or twelve weeks of therapy. Of course, severely loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> "normally shy", and they will require a good deal longer—probably from a low of six months to a maximum of two years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard, there is no time limit. Each person can feel free to remain with the program for as long as he or she may require. For a man the usual criterion indicating a satisfactory "cure" is the ability to comfortably initiate contacts with women who are not associated in any way with the practice-dating clinic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior to initially joining his or her group, each client needs to be given a brief orientation regarding behavior therapy techniques, and this should include how and why they work. Toward the conclusion of each 90-minute therapeutic session the chief facilitator assigns each of the twelve group members to a person of the opposite sex. During the early weeks of therapy this person selected by the therapist will be a fellow client from within the group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The instructions require each of the twelve members to go out on a date with his or her preselected partner some time before the next scheduled group meeting. Assuming that meetings are held for 90-minutes each Monday and Thursday afternoon, the "date" would have to be experienced by each member prior to the Thursday or Monday afternoon meeting. Each date is required to last for a minimum of two hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it can involve any activity of the couple's choosing except going to the movies, watching television, studying together, or anything that might discourage or obviate informal conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is made clear to each participant during the very first group meeting that silent periods can and probably will develop from time to time during each assigned date. Participants are counseled about the fact that silent periods are normal, and that they are nothing to worry about. During later therapeutic meetings a variety of techniques of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p527"></a>496 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">relaxation and of meditation are taught. Loveshy people tend to be quite tense, and this makes it quite difficult for them to get in touch with themselves and to truly be themselves. Indeed, tenseness also makes it unusually difficult for a person to think of things to talk about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tenseness invariably blocks the creative flow of ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each assigned date requires a specific time and place for getting together. This part must be arranged by the clients. And, in fact, it is usually arranged by the loveshy male. However, this is a task that is usually quite easy for most loveshys to handle because the therapist had specifically directed the two specific people to contact one another by telephone for the two-hour date. Thus, the girl is <i class="calibre4"> expecting</i> the young man to call; and she would normally feel constrained to phone him if he failed to make the contact within a reasonable time. Furthermore, she had already met the young man at the therapy meeting. Inasmuch as he knows whom he is calling and since he knows that she is expecting his call <i class="calibre4"> because it had been assigned, </i> he can follow the prescribed instructions without feeling any noteworthy apprehensions. He can negotiate a time and place for the meeting without feeling threatened in any way because he, the girl to whom he has been assigned, and all other practice-dating clients had agreed to the same set of ground rules.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the next 90-minute therapy meeting on Thursday or Monday afternoon each of the twelve members will discuss his/her experiences on his/her "practice-date". Participants are encouraged to be frank during these sessions so that everyone is able to gain an awareness of his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her strengths and of areas wherein improvements are warrented. Much of the time during each therapy meeting is devoted to interpersonal skills training, grooming, posture and poise, speech patterns, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Psychodrama and role playing also figure quite prominently in the therapeutic exercises that are commonly used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again towards the end of the 90-minute period the therapist will pair up each of the twelve clients—this time to a different member of the opposite sex. And prior to the following Monday's (or Thursday's) meeting each participant will again be expected to get together with his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her assigned date for a two-hour outing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same procedure is followed for each meeting. Again, many practice-dating clinics provide for only weekly meetings. Twice-weekly meetings are definitely preferable as these provide for a more intensive immersion of each client in the various facets of the treatment process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, for most clients progress tends to be remarkably rapid even when the group meetings and assigned practice dates are limited to once per week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the early weeks of involvement in the program, dating is limited to the women in the group. Thus, each loveshy man will be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p528"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 497</p>
<p class="calibre1">accorded the opportunity to get to know the six women of his group quite well. And since women tend to require fewer weeks/months of this therapy than the men do, the average loveshy man will probably be assigned to as many as nine or ten different women who become members of his group. In other words, as one female client drops out, another is immediately added. Again, this is necessary in order to keep the gender ratio even and to assure effective therapeutic progress for all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If more than one practice-dating group is being operated simultaneously—and this is very often the case on larger university campuses—each male and female client will be given a list of all men and women currently involved in practice-dating therapy. These lists will include just the name of the person and his/her telephone number.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is quite commonplace for loveshy male clients to begin phoning women on this list several weeks prior to the time when this is actually prescribed and required by the therapist. Thus, the experience of going out on assigned dates with each of the six female members of his group will have so effectively worked to extinguish many of his anxieties that he soon becomes able to contact women whom he does not know but whom he knows to be involved in practice-dating groups other than his own—</p>
<p class="calibre1">or who had been involved in practice-dating therapy at some time in the past. Graduates and/or dropouts from practice-dating therapy are noted on the list so that the men can distinguish between the names of women who are currently involved in the therapy, and the names of those who are no longer involved in the program.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Along about the sixth week of the practice-dating regimen, the therapist specifically assigns each male client the homework exercise of phoning a female member of another practice-dating group for a date.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually by this time this therapeutic exercise arouses little anxiety. He has already dated each of the six girls in his own group approximately twice; and he knows that the girls in the other groups are going to be as psychologically open to his call as the girls in his own group. Every six or seven weeks dances are held for members of all the practice-dating groups; and attendance by all is required at these. The comparatively few severely loveshy men who after six weeks of treatment remain emotionally incapable of calling a girl member of a practice-dating group other than their own are now accorded the opportunity of formally meeting <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the female clients. Particularly inhibited men are accorded special attention at these dances by the therapeutic staff. And this attention operates to diminish shyness-related anxieties to the point wherein even the most severely loveshy male client gradually becomes emotionally capable of approaching any female practice-dating participant, irrespective of whatever therapy group to which she might belong.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p529"></a>498 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the heterosexual interaction anxieties of each participant become progressively lessened with each new dating experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assigned dates with the six members of a person's own group serve to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"get the ball rolling". Subsequent assigned dates with members of other practice-dating groups serve to further facilitate this process. At the outset each of these dates is assigned by the therapist. The participants must arrange by telephone for time and place; but the therapist makes clear to each male just exactly whom he is supposed to call. However, as the weeks pass more and more males become emotionally capable of calling non-assigned women on their own. At first the non-assigned women called are fellow members of the various practice-dating groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The calling and arranging of meetings with non-assigned women is strongly encouraged and rewarded after the fifth week of therapy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided that the date with the assigned woman is also experienced some time prior to the next group meeting. During the first five weeks members are asked to confine their dates to the partners who had been specifically assigned to them. And effective screening constitutes a major reason for this policy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Screening</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Few non-shy men will be comfortable with the various exercises engaged in by the practice-dating therapy groups. Nevertheless, a non-shy male will occasionally slip into a group quite irrespective of all the careful screening that is done involving paper-and-pencil personality tests, shyness tests, one-on-one interviews vis-a-vis psychologists, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the relative shortage of women clients relative to men clients, it is important that inappropriate male clients be weeded out of the program as early in their involvement with it as possible. This is because (1) their presence in the group is at the expense of far more needy men who remain on the waiting list, and (2) because their presence exacerbates the anxieties of women participants who may not be emotionally ready for confident and assertive male behavior. In fact, if too many inappropriate males were to slip into practice-dating programs it would serve to arouse the suspicions and defensiveness of the women participants—thus making it all the more difficult for the genuinely loveshy males to do the required homework exercises and make the required telephone calls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One way of dealing with this problem is to prohibit any non-assigned dates during the first five weeks of involvement in the program.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the most prudent approach is to subject all male applicants to a screening process that is sufficiently thoroughgoing that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p530"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 499</p>
<p class="calibre1">comparatively non-shy males can be detected and weeded out beforehand. Borderline or mildly shy males can and should be assigned to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"shyness clinic" or to an "assertiveness training" program similar to the one operated by Zimbardo and his associates at Stanford University.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zimbardo-styled "shyness clinic" programs will frighten away all severely and chronically loveshy men. But for the <i class="calibre4"> borderline shy</i> they appear to accomplish a substantial amount of good. One man's meat is another person's poison!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, it might even be suggested to males <i class="calibre4"> graduating</i> from practice-dating programs that they might benefit from attendance at a shyness clinic or assertiveness training group. In essence, they might be told:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now you have the female companionship that you've always wanted plus the emotional freedom necessary to enjoy this companionship and, if necessary, to seek out additional female companionship. However, there may still be other areas of your life where you are still too shy and inhibited: e.g., employment seeking, starting conversations with strangers, being friendly and open with people, filing necessary complaints about bad service, giving public talks, making cold telephone calls in sales work, making friendly and sincere comments of praise vis-a-vis clients before you get down to business with them, giving compliments, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Participation in a shyness clinic or an assertiveness training group can help you grow in the directions of your choosing in all of these areas."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Dealing with the Love and Beauty Problem</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have clearly documented earlier in this book, the issue of female pulchritude often represents one of the toughest stumbling blocks in helping loveshy men. Since the days of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome, we have known that beauty (especially facial beauty) is the prime stimulus inspiring a man to become romantically infatuated with a woman. Indeed, beauty often triggers a loveshy man's infatuation long before he has ever met or interacted in any way with the women possessing that beauty. And to be sure, the rules and policies of practice-dating therapy cannot change this quirk of human character. But these rules and policies <i class="calibre4"> can curb</i> this penchant and preoccupation with beauty, <i class="calibre4">at least</i> to the extent that it is not allowed to interfere with the promotion of the kinds of psychoemotional growth that practice-dating is designed to facilitate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the therapist makes clear at the outset that clients are not expected to fall in love with or to develop any type of lasting romantic commitments to their practice-dating partners. Of course if a romantic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p531"></a>500 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest develops anyway,  <i class="calibre4"> then fine! </i> However, the purpose of practice-dating as a therapeutic modality is to enable loveshy, socially inactive men and women to get to really know and appreciate the opposite sex as living, thinking, feeling human beings just like themselves. Practice-dating is further intended to remove false and destructive illusions about the other sex—illusions which promote separateness, mutual suspicion and non-interaction. The belief that only conspicuously attractive women are worth getting to know and appreciate is one of the most destructive and self-limiting of these illusions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, whereas extinction of destructive shyness-related anxieties is the main function of practice-dating, other functions are also of crucial importance. Severely loveshy men typically live deep in a world of fantasy. And this fantasy is highlighted by a mental set incorporating highly pulchritudinous female faces. It is the indispensable job of practice-dating therapy to catalyze the loveshys into moving out of their fantasy worlds into the world of actual social interaction with real, live women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the first things loveshy men learn in practice-dating is that women who at the outset appeared to be of only average looks often turn out to be incredibly charming and worth knowing on a long-term basis. Indeed, loveshys often begin to fall in love with some of the practice-dating partners whom they see often. It is not necessary that a man like each of his practice-dating partners equally well. Such would obviously be unrealistic. However, he must learn to deal with all of his assigned partners as potential friends. And he must learn to go beneath the superficial surface of overt personality and get to know and truly appreciate at least a few of his practice-dating partners.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, we are dealing here with prime therapeutic goals. Therapy is deemed to be far from complete with any man who persists in interacting with all of his assigned dates with a detached attitude because none of them befit his mental set incorporating a beautiful face, long hair, thin legs and thighs, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Emotionally detached attitudes are picked up intuitively by the practice-dating partners; and these are among the matters that are dealt with during the twice-weekly group therapy sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it may surprise some readers to learn that not all of the women electing to receive practice-dating therapy are of only average attractiveness. In fact, some of them are surprisingly attractive. And some of them even have the "long hair and pretty face" which loveshy men typically crave. I think the <i class="calibre4"> average</i> attractiveness level of loveshy <i class="calibre4">males</i> receiving practice-dating therapy tends to be a slight bit below the average male attractiveness on any given university campus. But this does <i class="calibre4"> not</i> appear to be the case for women clients of practice-dating therapy. The attractiveness level of the women clients tends to be quite</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p532"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 501</p>
<p class="calibre1">on a par with the general female attractiveness level of the campus upon which they are taking courses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Self-consciousness problems pertaining to level of personal attractiveness are dealt with during the group meetings. For example, there are frequent discussions about various techniques of upgrading grooming patterns, making clothing purchases more wisely, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> But more importantly, the positive mental attitudes and enhanced self-confidence which the therapeutic regimen promotes also serve to significantly enhance the ostensible physical attractiveness levels of all practice-dating participants. Thus,  <i class="calibre4"> it is true</i> that people of both sexes look better when they feel positive about themselves, and when they are fired with enthusiasm about life. Practice-dating serves to accomplish these goals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of crucial importance is the fact that people tend to learn some very important things about themselves only to the extent that they interact regularly and informally with other people—particularly with those of the opposite sex. This is why loveshy men quite commonly experience an almost religious awakening when they come to find genuine delight in being with an opposite-sexed companion who (from an objective standpoint) is not highly attractive. Loveshy men often begin to perceive exquisite physical beauty in the many subtle aspects of someone who at first meeting had not appeared conspicuously attractive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once this begins to happen, the loveshy man is freed to begin noticing and relishing all sorts of richness in the <i class="calibre4"> personalities</i> of the women whom he is dating. This is important because it is on the basis of these attributes of personality that most emotionally mature, well-adjusted people eventually make their final selections of a marriage partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Alcoholics Anonymous Model of Mutual Caring and</i> <i class="calibre4">Concern</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the key therapeutic goals is to make the therapeutic group a cohesive unit and, indeed, a kind of quasi-kin group that will provide emotional supports for its fellow members when they are in need. The development of close same-sexed friendships among each of the six same-sexed members is strongly encouraged. Same-sexed members of a group are encouraged to see each other outside of the group, and to help each other with various problems that might crop up. For example, when a member fails to show up for a meeting a fellow male member is asked to go check up on the missing person, and to help him deal with any problems that might have arisen. Difficulties or avoidance of the assigned homework exercises involving dating or the arranging of assigned dates is also dealt with through the promotion of interested</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p533"></a>502 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">involvement by fellow members of the client's own gender, and often of the opposite gender as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On some campuses the graduates of practice-dating remain so enthusiastic about what the program had done for them that they agree to interact as friends with neophytes (new practice-dating clients) of their own gender. The development of close, emotionally meaningful friendships with these experienced former clients is strongly encouraged. Alcoholics Anonymous has long encouraged such friendships among its experienced and inexperienced members. And this has long been a prime factor accounting for the huge success of "AA" in keeping its members "on the wagon".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, loveshy people (especially males), similar to many other kinds of deviants in society, tend to have had a long history of very little or no kin-group support or meaningful kin-group interaction. People with such a history tend to benefit in important ways from becoming members of <i class="calibre4"> quasi</i>-kin groups that are appropos to their needs and interests. Such quasi-kin groups currently include Alcoholics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous, Parents Anonymous/Mothers Anonymous (both for child abusers), Gray Panthers, Gay Liberation Front (for homosexuals), Mothers of Terminally Ill Children, Families of Cancer Victims, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> At various points in this book I have suggested the development of a Shys Anonymous/LoveShys Anonymous that would serve the needs of afflicted heterosexually oriented persons of all ages, and that would also provide for the development of a much needed political power base.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The membership of the 12-person practice-dating therapy groups can serve many of these same functions.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Visualization and Mental Rehearsal</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A</i> basic precept of behavior therapy is that the physiological and neurological mechanisms of the human body cannot tell the difference between (1) actual behavioral experience, and (2) the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> experience vividly imagined and visualized. Visualization exercises have a long and distinguished history as a viable therapeutic modality. In fact, their use goes back as far as the days of ancient Egypt. And during the middle ages of western civilization they were an integral and often feared (misunderstood) part of the practices of the religion of witchcraft. Today visualization exercises are as likely to be championed by hard-headed, pragmatic business leaders as they are by witches and warlocks. Indeed, visualization and mental rehearsal have become an accepted part of the <i class="calibre4">routeine preparation</i> of such widely diverse groups as star athletes, gymn-ists, golfing pros, tennis stars, professional football players, renouned</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p534"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 503</p>
<p class="calibre1">piano and trumpet players, actors and actresses, star salespeople, business and sales managers, and American astronauts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The question as to why visualization and mental rehearsal work so effectively is beyond the scope of this book. However, some clues are provided in chapter 23. Doubtless visualization is closely tied to certain metaphysical and occult processes such a psychokenesis (PK), meditation, thought becoming form, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Suffice it to say here that visualization and mental rehearsal are rapidly becoming an integral component of practice-dating therapy—which is itself a form of behavior therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally the visualization exercises are assigned as homework, although occasionally an individual group member or two will be helped through a visualization exercise during a group session. It must be stressed that performing these homework exercises requires considerable self-discipline—more self-discipline, in fact, than many practice-dating clients are capable of. This represents a key reason as to why severely loveshy men absolutely require a support group; and fellow practice-dating clients of both sexes constitute an outstanding basis for a support group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As visualization exercises tend to be most effective when they are practiced in the early morning upon arising and just before going to bed at night, it is just at these times that fellow clients of practice-dating groups are asked to pair up with each other and to catalyze each other's efforts towards the actual <i class="calibre4"> doing</i> of the visualization and meditational exercises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, clients are asked to work in twos. One member induces the other into a light meditative trance. Once that member has been made to feel deeply relaxed, a scenario involving friendly, assertive heterosexual interaction is introduced. It is introduced by being read from a 5 by 8 card very quietly to the recipient in the trance. Usually the scenario will involve approaching or talking to a girl with whom the entranced subject has long wanted to make social contact. As these sessions usually last twenty minutes to a half-hour a piece, only one person can be the recipient of the help per session. Thus, if client "A"</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the recipient during a morning meditational session, then during the evening session the roles will be reversed and client <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> will help client</p>
<p class="calibre1">"B" by reading a visualization scenario and inducing in client "B" a light meditational trance. Eventually, of course, it is hoped that each practice-dating client will feel impelled to do these visualization and mental rehearsal exercises on his/her own. But severely shy people are characterized by a high degree of behavioral inertia as well as an attitudinal pessimism and cynicism that commonly obviates taking any action at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p535"></a>504 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Approaching these feelings of discouragement and their consequent behavioral inertia with a moralistic air—as many American psychotherapists do—is invariably counterproductive. It is perfectly understandable as to why severely shy men are bogged down by inertia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the support groups precipitated by well-run practice-dating therapy groups provide for an outstanding remedy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, a person tends to become what he/she thinks about. Support groups composed of both sexes are needed to almost constantly monitor the thoughts, self-talk, and the visualizations of severely loveshy people. Visualization exercises entailing friendly, assertive behavior vis-a-vis opposite sexed eligibles is known to substantially facilitate improvements caused by the practice-dating therapy itself. More specifically, practice-dating therapy and visualization/mental rehearsal exercises operate in synergistic interaction with each other to catalyze the most rapid psychoemotional and social growth in loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "Second Plateau" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A</i> therapist friend of mine once asked a loveshy client: "What the hell would you do with a girl after you actually got her home with you?!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the nutshell essence of what the "second plateau" of loveshyness is all about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are basically two different plateaus of difficulty in dealing with heterosexual loveshyness. And practice-dating must effectively remedy both of these in order to prove successful for people in any lasting way. The first of these plateaus has to do with initiating a relationship with a woman and getting it launched. As I have shown, the very thought of doing this arouses a tremendous amount of anxiety in the loveshy and usually works to keep the majority of loveshy males from ever getting anywhere near the second plateau.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second plateau has to do with <i class="calibre4"> being oneself, </i> and with being able <i class="calibre4"> to relax</i> and <i class="calibre4"> to communicate on a feeling level</i> vis-a-vis the person with whom one hopes to develop a lasting relationship. Most loveshy men find that they devote the first four or five dates with a person to superficial small talk. This small talk represents a kind of "prepared script".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a form of self-disclosure it is limited to such topics as what they are majoring in, what they are doing or wish to do for a living, where their family lives, what the father does or did for a living, television shows and movies, trivia, the weather, and other similar forms of what for lack of a better word might be termed "bullshit"—or "bullpoopoo" if you prefer!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several loveshys told me that their first few dates with a girl are very reminiscent of their first two or three visits with a new psychiatrist!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, they find themselves bored with the very words that are pouring</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p536"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 505</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of their mouths because they have been over these same words ("prepared script") so many hundreds of times with so many hundreds of different people. Most human beings sooner or later become very tired of reiterating the same material about who they are, what their interests and hobbies are, what their parents are like, etc., that very little of the true self is permitted to show when this type of "bullpoopoo"</p>
<p class="calibre1">is discussed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The jist of this is that many people lose their nerve again after they have run out of all of these superficial conversational topics. Loveshy men will typically stop seeing a woman they really care about (1) because there are now too many uncomfortable silences due to the fact that they cannot think of anything more to talk about; (2) because they haven't got the nerve to kiss the girl goodnight or to commence any other form of physical lovemaking; and (3) because the girl as a result of her own shyness (and feelings of insecurity vis-a-vis the loveshy man) is of no help in overcoming these barriers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating therapy is charged with the responsibility of getting each of its clients past this barrier posed by the "second plateau". The experience of dating and informally interacting with a variety of assigned women helps out considerably in this regard. In essence, a large amount of experience with practice-dating serves to foster an increased ability to relax in the company of women, to be oneself, and to perceive women of different levels of attractiveness as being non-anxiety-provoking, nonthreatening human beings just like themselves. To the extent that people are not tense or in the throes of anxiety, to that extent new and creative thoughts and ideas start to easily flow from the mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the practice-dating itself is not enough to ready a person for competently and successfully getting past the hurdle represented by the "second plateau". This is why a variety of exercises are incorporated into each of the group meetings. Loveshy men tend to be extremely defensive and fearful of exposing their vulnerabilities. Lacking the interpersonal skills, they also lack the finesse and social spontaneity necessary for smoothly moving towards such physical displays of affection as kissing, necking, petting, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Make no mistake about it! Such physical displays are <i class="calibre4"> normatively</i> <i class="calibre4">prescribed</i> in our culture after a certain number of dates have transpired with the same woman. And a woman will very seldom feel comfortable about accepting additional dates with a man who does not respond to these normative prescriptions. Indeed, she is quite likely to begin <i class="calibre4"> wrongly</i> perceiving such a shy and inhibited man as being a "latent homosexual".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she cannot understand him, "latent homosexual" seems to be a logical enough label to apply to him—even though it is a quite false label.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In American society we tend to be so preoccupied with the far more typical male behavior of "moving too fast" with a woman, that we tend</p>

<p class="calibre1">to neglect the fact that men who "move too slowly" with a woman (for other than overtly stated religious reasons) <i class="calibre4"> also violate norms. </i> And these normative violations are often a good deal more difficult for a woman to deal with than the "moving too fast" type of violation. Most young women have received a good deal of socialization from both peers and parents about ways of successfully dealing with the excessively "fast mover". Never having received any socialization about ways of dealing with the excessively "slow mover", the typical woman tends to become confused, worried and upset. Again, people tend to most strongly fear those things (behaviors and <i class="calibre4"> behavioral omissions)</i> which they have never been prepared to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the relationship is right, loveshy men tend to have as much if not more "desire" than non-shys. It must be emphasized that the entire life history of most loveshy men is one of emotional blockage from doing many of the things they would really like to do. Thus, the inhibition gene is an extremely cruel and constantly vigilant taskmaster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one reason why Zimbardo has likened shyness to a <i class="calibre4"> prison</i> that is every bit as real and in some ways even more restricting than a real prison would be. In America we learn from early childhood to judge attitudes, values, intentions and desires,  <i class="calibre4"> by behavior. </i> With loveshy men you cannot do this because their <i class="calibre4"> behavioral omissions</i> very often do not accurately reflect what they truly want, value and desire. Thus, the mental prison created by the inhibition gene prohibits loveshys from manifesting behavior that is <i class="calibre4"> congruent</i> with their feelings, attitudes and desires.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">When a Practice-Dating Participant Fails to Show Up</i> There will be times when a practice-dating participant fails to show up for a required group meeting. Most of the time the reasons for this are legitimate. But because the degree of commitment to practice-dating is almost always stronger for males than for females, absentees are more likely than not to involve female participants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An absent female means that one of the six male members will have to go without a practice-date for the coming half-week or week, unless one of the remaining five women participants is willing to experience two practice dates. Thus, the therapist can (1) either arrange it so that one of the women (perhaps a different one each time) is assigned to <i class="calibre4"> two</i> practice dates, or (2) a rotational system can be used. If a rotational system is employed, then each of the six male participants in a group takes his turn at <i class="calibre4"> not</i> having a practice-date prior to the next group meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is, of course, no fully satisfactory or "smooth" method for handling no-shows. If the absent member did not phone in prior to his/</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p538"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 507</p>
<p class="calibre1">her intended absence, it is very important that the therapist and/or two or three of the group members phone that absent member as soon as possible after the missed meeting. The purpose of the call is (1) to ascertain whether or not the absent member wishes to remain a part of a practice-dating group, and (2) to encourage further participation if the absent member is inadequately committed to further involvement. If the absent member cannot be brought back into the group, it is important that they be replaced as rapidly as possible so that the sex ratio can be kept even at six males and six females.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have indicated, it will always be easy to replace male members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in order to keep matters fair and orderly, waiting lists should be used for this. Efforts need to be kept constantly ongoing for purposes of recruiting female participants. Indeed, waiting lists can also be used for interested women. And these can include (1) any young woman who wishes to enhance her interpersonal skills and social self-confidence vis-a-vis the male sex, and (2) already self-confident young women who wish to do some "community service" and help out. For example, sorority girls could be offered an opportunity to earn "brownie points" for community service, by committing themselves for a period of time to a practice-dating therapy group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the level and severity of loveshyness among potential female participants need not be anywhere nearly as "desperate" or "painful"</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it needs to be for participating males. In other words, only those males <i class="calibre4"> really</i> in need of it should be assigned to a practice-dating group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Less needy males can be referred to a "shyness clinic". And appropriate screening needs to be done towards this end.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Participants who phone in an intended absence will usually be much more deeply and sincerely committed to the practice-dating program. For this reason, it should be a policy of all practice-dating groups that absences be phoned in <i class="calibre4"> in advance</i> whenever this is feasible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In most instances, those phoning in an anticipated absence can still be assigned a practice-date for that half-week (or one week) period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And, of course, this should be done. As practice-dating groups (if they are worth their salt) are basically <i class="calibre4"> support</i> groups and <i class="calibre4"> friendship groups</i> in addition to being therapy groups, some of the regularly attending members can fill in the absent member on the basic essence of what he/she had missed—and of any special instructions pertinent to this week's (or half-week's) practice-date.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In cases wherein the level of commitment to practice-dating is sufficiently strong, absentees (other than those who had phoned in their <i class="calibre4">intended</i> absence) can still be assigned a practice-date for the applicable half-week or one-week period. If the therapist maintains a reasonably accurate handle on each participant's level of commitment (and the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p539"></a>508 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship bonds within a practice-dating group have become strong), a practice-date can be assigned over the telephone to a female participant who had not shown up for a group meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"Going Outside" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">University-based practice-dating therapy programs should make copious use of local area high schools. Most men prefer women who are a few years their junior. And this is especially true for loveshy men, most of whom possess an above-average need to have a woman partner who will "look up" to them and see them as being "someone special".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through advertising and promoting practice-dating programs in local area high schools, the gender ratio problem as well as problems created by absenteeism can both be greatly minimized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In due course all high schools will have their own practice-dating therapy programs. But until they do it is best to upgrade to the maximum the one practice-dating program that might exist in any given community. This "going outside" to the high schools would be geared almost exclusively towards the recruitment of <i class="calibre4"> female</i> participants. A minimum age of 18 might be insisted upon for <i class="calibre4"> male</i> participation. However, in return for their cooperation in making a practice-dating program a success, loveshy males in the selected high schools could be guaranteed priority status for receiving practice-dating therapy as soon as they turn 18 or graduate from high school. Such a promise should go over well with loveshy high school males (1) because such males tend to <i class="calibre4"> live in</i> <i class="calibre4">the future</i> anyway, and (2) because very few loveshy high school males would wish to "practice-date" with women who are older than they.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, loveshy males are extremely romantic; and it is simply not seen as "romantic" for a male to date a woman who is older than he.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, the loveshy male needs a feeling of power, influence, superior knowledge, etc., over his dating partner and potential lover. And one way of securing this self-confidence boosting feeling is through dating a girl who is younger by at least a few years. In this respect local high school girls could be extremely good for loveshy university-age males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, the girls would be "safe"! Remember: loveshy males are extremely fearful of assuming any kind of assertive role vis-a-vis the female sex in informal social situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Waiting Lists</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two methods for developing waiting lists for loveshy males desirous of practice-dating therapy: (1) the "first come, first served"</p>
<p class="calibre1">method, and (2) the "severity of the problem" or "severity of need"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p540"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 509</p>
<p class="calibre1">method. The latter would include such considerations as <i class="calibre4"> how many years</i> the individual has suffered from his chronic loveshyness, whether or not he has <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> dated or interacted informally with girls, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If college and university practice-dating therapists engage in an active program of recruitment of high school aged girls and non-college attending girls into the program, lengthy waiting lists for needy loveshy males should not be a problem. However, when waiting lists do develop I personally recommend the "severity of need" method be given priority over the "first come, first served" method. A combination of both methods can and inevitably will be used. But sensible screening methods along with just plain human compassion would dictate that those most in need (1) stand to benefit the most, and (2) will pose the most interesting and stimulating challenges for the therapeutic staff. In short, the most prudent screening policies will assure that those most in need will receive the most prompt and thoroughgoing therapeutic attention.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Practice-Dating Therapy for High Schoolers</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating therapy needs to become easily accessible to people of <i class="calibre4"> all</i> ages. However, the category of persons for whom this mode of therapy would ultimately do the most good is that of loveshy high school students. This is because the nipping of problems in the bud serves to <i class="calibre4"> prevent</i> many long years of needless suffering. Further, there is evidence that the younger a client is, the easier it is to get a therapeutic approach to work for him/her. Simply put, therapy works faster and easier for younger clients.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I stressed earlier in this book, loveshyness even among five and six-year old children is <i class="calibre4"> destructive</i> and needs to be remedied. Shyness blocks free choice, self-determination, and the taking of personal responsibility for one's actions and inactions. This is a very dangerous state of affairs in a society such as ours that <i class="calibre4"> assumes</i> the operation in the lives of all citizens of self-determination and personal responsibility. Social norms may stand in the way of developing practice-dating programs for elementary school aged and junior high school aged youngsters. Nevertheless, the wise, prudent and sensitive parent or teacher will see to it that seven-year old Johnny develops the sense of personal freedom <i class="calibre4"> to</i> <i class="calibre4">talk</i> to six-year old Suzie instead of daydreaming about her all day long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they will work towards the engineering of social festivities that will get Johnny and Suzie working together on projects. In essence, they will get Johnny and Suzie interacting through means which are subtle, tactful, nonthreatening, fully natural, and non-embarrassing. It if is indeed best for Johnny to avoid emotionally intimate interaction with a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p541"></a>510 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl until he is much older, then he should be furnished with information which <i class="calibre4"> might</i> lead him to decide on a rational, voluntary basis to avoid such interaction. But such would have to be <i class="calibre4"> his</i> decision. Neither he nor anyone should <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> have to avoid heterosexual interaction because of the genetically induced (inhibition gene) mental prison of loveshyness!</p>
<p class="calibre1">In our society the high school represents the youngest level at which the instituting of practice-dating therapy programs would be normatively practicable. And such instituting <i class="calibre4"> should be done! </i> Loveshy high schoolers must never be dealt with via the immoral, laissez-faire attitude:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, leave them alone; they've got plenty of time". Loveshyness problems <i class="calibre4"> do not</i> take care of themselves with the passing of time. Left alone loveshyness problems can and do become increasingly worse, NOT</p>
<p class="calibre1">better! And furthermore, even though it may not be feasible to offer practice-dating therapy <i class="calibre4"> below</i> the high school level, I believe that informal heterosexual interaction programs <i class="calibre4"> for boys without sisters</i> can quite easily be justified and supported, even at the elementary school level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What <i class="calibre4"> justice</i> is there in 90 percent of a high school class attending dances and proms when Johnny cannot go because he is afflicted with the inhibition gene and its consequent loveshyness prison syndrome?!</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is <i class="calibre4"> wrong</i> to assume that behavior (or behavioral inaction or omission) always reflects personal preference—e.g., that the reason why Johnny isn't going to dances is because he really doesn't want to go, or because he is really a "latent homosexual", or because he "isn't ready yet".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In American the modal (most commonplace) age for the commencement of dating is 15. This is the case for young people of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> genders and for middle-class suburbanites and small town residents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The term <i class="calibre4"> "modal" </i> means that more boys and girls commence dating at 15 than at any other age that is either older or younger than 15. Young people need to feel as though they are a part of the mainstream of things.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They also need to feel as though they have some control over their own lives. To be sure, mindless conformity to the dictates of <i class="calibre4"> either</i> parents <i class="calibre4">or</i> peers doesn't make any sense. But allowing a situation to persist wherein the loveshyness syndrome <i class="calibre4"> dominates</i> the lives of certain young people <i class="calibre4"> makes even less sense. </i> In order for a young person to make rational decisions and to act in accordance with these decisions, he/she <i class="calibre4"> cannot</i> <i class="calibre4">stay shy! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, practice-dating therapy can be expected to work both faster and easier for high school aged teenagers than for university aged young people. Strong practice-dating programs at the high school level represent strong <i class="calibre4"> preventive medicine</i> that will ultimately benefit not only the treated loveshy individuals but the wider society as well. Success in the employment sector and everywhere else depends to a greater extent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p542"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 511</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon social self-confidence and interpersonal finesse than it does upon technical knowledge or formal education. Rare indeed is the high school boy who would rationally choose to remain at home while 90 percent of his fellow classmates are in attendance at parties with "dates" of the opposite sex. Socially inactive loveshys tend to manifest scores of symptoms each and every day, thus letting both parents and teachers know who they are. It is time that we heeded these symptoms and accorded our young people a behavior-oriented remedy that <i class="calibre4"> really</i> works. Practice-dating therapy fills the bill!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Termination of Therapy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is only one major criterion for determining when a formerly loveshy man no longer requires further participation in practice-dating therapy. Simply put, when a man <i class="calibre4"> on his own</i> contacts a woman who has never had anything whatever to do with practice-dating, the need for this form of therapy is on the verge of being over. Thus, if a man feels secure about contacting new women in the outside world towards whom he feels attracted, the practice-dating experience has successfully accomplished its essential job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most loveshys seem to reach this point within approximately six to twelve months of the time when they initially commence therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus they begin telephoning women whom they meet in their university classes, places of business, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In fact, many of them begin to initiate relationships on their own by starting conversations with women on an in-person basis. The fact that some of these initial attempts lead to rejection or to one or another type of "turn down" is no longer emotionally unnerving to them. They have become able to assert themselves in a relaxed, friendly way vis-a-vis women they do not know because their six to twelve (or more) months of practice-dating therapy had served to successfully <i class="calibre4"> extinguish</i> their fears about experiencing anxiety and because it had served to drastically raise their social self-confidence level. The minor anxieties which they do experience from time to time no longer impede them in any significant way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An increasing number of practice-dating therapists today also want to make sure that their clients have mastered "the second plateau" before they totally leave therapy. Hence, once a man becomes capable of asking for dates on his own he may discontinue the "practice-dating" aspect of this therapy. But he will continue attending the practice-dating group therapy meetings until he has come to feel confident about (1) exposing his true feelings vis-a-vis his girlfriend after he has reached the seventh or eighth date with her and the usual "bullshit" superficialities can no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p543"></a>512 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer be discussed or rehashed; and (2) kissing his girlfriend and getting started with the physical/sexual manifestations of loving and romantic feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases practice-dating therapists will operate separate groups for those who have successfully completed the basic therapy. Groups which are operated for those who have completed the basic therapy are usually kept fairly small, seldom exceeding five or six members. The ideal is for each group to be composed of three men and three women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, important exercises in psychodrama and role playing can be easily facilitated. Video-tape machines are often used as an adjunct to these exercises. Such technology permits the client to become more mindful of his style of conversation and of informal heterosexual interaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And like psychodrama itself, it permits him to more rapidly (and accurately) become cognizant of the way he impacts upon other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Psychodrama and Role Playing</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Much of each 90-minute period in practice-dating group therapy is devoted to exercises in psychodrama. In psychodrama the therapist presents the group of clients with a scenario which entails informal heterosexual interaction, and which might well be expected to arouse anxiety in a loveshy person. One man and one woman will usually be singled out for each exercise in psychodrama. The girl might be asked to play the person in whom the loveshy man has a strong romantic interest. A scene is described by the therapist, and the two people are asked to improvise a "play" over about a ten minute period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In psychodrama each participant is given the opportunity to improvise a role within the safety of the therapy office. And occasionally the scenario described by the therapist at the outset of an exercise will require a "role reversal", in which case a man might be asked to play a girl, and the girl will be asked to play a loveshy man. During each exercise the video-tape machine will commonly record everything that is going on so that the participants can review it all afterward, and so that the other members of the therapy support group can more easily make constructive suggestions so that the next "performance" in a similar situation can be better, more successful, rewarding, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychodrama has been found to represent an extremely powerful therapeutic device. Through its use people get to experience what it feels like to exist "in the shoes" of another human being. And as per the old proverb: "You never really understand a man (or woman) until you get to walk a mile in his/her moccasins." In essence, the procedure teaches compassion and understanding of others, as well as self-knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p544"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 513</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a process in successful interpersonal relationships which sociologists call <i class="calibre4"> "role taking". </i> Role taking <i class="calibre4"> is not</i> the same thing as "role playing". Role playing simply involves playing a role—taking on the vested interests and "soul" of a particular character. Fine actors do that all the time; it is an integral part of their work. However, in <i class="calibre4"> role taking</i> a person tries to "feel for" the other person (e.g., dating partner) with whom he/she is interacting, and whom he/she is hoping to influence in some way (e.g., accept an invitation for a second date, accept an invitation to "go farther" sexually, etc.). In "role taking" a person tries to anticipate the thoughts and feelings of his/her partner all the while the informal interaction is proceeding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, the better a person becomes at "role taking", the easier it becomes for him/her to move the relationship in the direction of his/her choosing. The other person comes to <i class="calibre4"> want to</i> "go along". They feel safe and secure with the person who is good at "role taking", because they have come to trust him/her to respect their feelings, needs and wishes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The role playing exercises that are endemic to psychodrama quite effectively teach the participants both "role taking" and "role playing".</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the exercises are carried out in a supportive, noncompetitive setting (as in practice-dating therapy), they enable the person to come to grips with whatever he/she may be doing wrong, and to plan for a more effective "performance" in the future. Thus, the exercises gradually serve to enormously upgrade social self-confidence and social finesse vis-avis the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No <i class="calibre4"> Time Limit</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important virtues of practice-dating therapy is that there are no time limits to it. If a client appears to be suffering from a particularly intractable case of loveshyness, he is made to feel free about remaining with the program for as long as he chooses, and for as long as he needs it. Regardless of whether a person remains in therapy for a brief period of time or for a long period of time, the <i class="calibre4"> principle of extinction</i> remains the dynamic whereby destructive inhibitions and anxiety fears are gradually relinquished. A small minority of men (especially older loveshys) have to "practice-date" scores of women before they become disinhibited enough to loosen up and contact women on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody has his/her own internal "clock" or "timetable", and it is viewed as counterproductive to "give up" on a person simply because he/she is taking a long time to display meaningful growth or progress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the therapeutic regimen is not entirely permissive. All participants must go out on all assigned practice dates; and all must</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p545"></a>514 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">attend the many group meetings and participate in the various exercises which take place at these meetings. In addition, there are various homework exercises. But on the other hand, failure of a client to cooperate in these matters is far less of a problem with practice-dating therapy than it is with "shyness clinic" therapy and "assertiveness training"</p>
<p class="calibre1">therapy. Again, in practice-dating, clients are never asked to do anything that is beyond their psychoemotional ability to handle, as a prerequisite for remaining in therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, practice-dating therapy trains its participants to be responsible to some extent for each other. As in Alcoholics Anonymous, people who have progressed quite a bit are encouraged to make friends with and to look in on less experienced and still somewhat frightened practice-dating participants. The idea is to make the newer participants feel as though their new group really does "give a damn' about their welfare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, practice-dating provides for the development of quasi-kinship groups—just as "AA" is a quasi-kinship group. Participants are made to feel that their fellows truly care about them and about their progress and growth.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the most severely loveshy men sometimes have to experience several complete turnovers of women participants in their particular practice-dating group. Nevertheless, the method works. Better than 90</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of even the most intractably loveshy males manage to eventually improve to the point at which they can effectively compete for women on their own. In essence, therapy that works is invariably <i class="calibre4"> a form of</i> <i class="calibre4">socialization. </i> And a prerequisite for any kind of socialization IS <i class="calibre4"> dependency. </i> The purpose of socialization is to enable a person to function adequately on his or her own—to provide him/her with the "bootstraps"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(including the social self-confidence) by which he/she <i class="calibre4"> can</i> "pull himself/</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself up".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologically speaking, loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> very late</i> in fulfilling certain very crucial <i class="calibre4"> developmental tasks. </i> Psychoemotionally their growth will remain stunted unless and until they do manage to fulfill these.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our society had failed to facilitate the loveshy (provide the requisite socialization) in the fulfilling of these "developmental tasks" when they (the loveshys) were in the "normal" and "expected" age bracket for their fulfilling—ages 13 through 16 throughout most of America.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, practice-dating is charged with doing for these men <i class="calibre4"> at</i> <i class="calibre4">a very late time</i> what society (including parents and teachers) had failed to do for them at the <i class="calibre4"> appropriate</i> times. Again, it cannot be too strongly stressed that <i class="calibre4"> dependency is a prerequisite for socialization, which is a prerequisite for any kind of mature and productive INDEPENDENCE and self-sufficiency. </i> At the normal ages for the commencement of dating and informal heterosexual interaction the loveshys were ignored because</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p546"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 515</p>
<p class="calibre1">they lacked the charm, attractiveness and poise of the majority of their fellow junior high schoolers. Practice-dating is simply a matter of accomplishing the "dirty work" which our highly competitive society had chosen to leave undone.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Exceptionally Stubborn Cases</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4"> only</i> men who cannot be cured by the practice-dating experience are those who cannot or will not do the assigned exercises. All told, this comes to less than five percent of those who commence practice-dating, and less than ten percent of all men actually in need of it. (This extra five percent accounts for the group that simply cannot be benevolently coaxed into a practice-dating group.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there are certain men—about 15 percent of those who enter practice-dating—who never seem to reach the point where they become emotionally capable of approaching women for dates strictly on their own.  <i class="calibre4"> All</i> of this 15 percent eventually gets "cured", and occasionally their needs are taken care of within a good deal less than a year's time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, some of their loveshyness problems are remedied even before those of some of the men who will eventually become capable of asking for dates strictly on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, what happens is that these men eventually find themselves in the midst of a mutual love relationship with one of their practice-dating partners. Just as it frequently happens outside of therapy in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"real world", loveshy men sometimes find themselves "in love with"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">(infatuated)</i> a girl who either doesn't care for them or who may not be aware of the fact that the man has a crush upon them. Such problems are dealt with during the therapy sessions. And when the group sessions prove inadequate for that task, one-on-one therapy is provided for the loveshy man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But if a man remains in practice-dating therapy long enough, sooner or later he will find himself with a girl with whom a mutual love relationship is genuinely feasible. This seldom happens vis-a-vis any of the six girls in the <i class="calibre4"> initial</i> therapy group. When it does happen it involves either a girl from a different practice-dating group, or it involves someone to whom the loveshy man had been assigned after one or two complete turnovers of women in his own group. Typically when this happens it will happen within six months to a year of the time when practice-dating therapy had first been commenced. Men with even the most severely stubborn cases of loveshyness will invariably find that it happens to them within a maximum of 18-months of full-fledged involvement in the assigned practice-dating exercises.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p547"></a>516 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">When a close,  <i class="calibre4"> genuinely mutual</i> love relationship does develop out of a set of assigned dating experiences, the man is given the option of either (1) remaining in therapy until the normal therapeutic goal of complete self-sufficiency in soliciting dates has been achieved, or (2) of dropping out and pursuing a strictly monogamous courtship relationship with his chosen love-mate. If he chooses the second option (and about 75 percent of loveshy men do), he is given the freedom to return for either one-on-one or group treatment at any time in the future the felt need might arise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This represents a controversial point among traditional psychotherapists of even the behavior therapy persuasion. The reason, of course, is that those men have not arrived at the ostensible therapeutic goal of full self-sufficiency. They remain as yet emotionally incapable of assuming the assertive role vis-a-vis women they do not know, and of constructively dealing with anxiety feelings accruing from the inevitable rejection that is part and parcel of "the dating game" in American society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It comes as a surprise to most traditional psychotherapists that a large proportion of successfully married American men had never in their lives asked a stranger for a date. As I documented earlier in this book, many men are introduced to their future wives by members of their extended kinship and/or friendship networks. Simply put, it is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> merely loveshyness-related anxieties vis-a-vis the female sex which keep some severely shy men from ever marrying. Of perhaps equal importance is the fact that the chronically loveshy male HAS NEVER HAD</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING AN INTEGRAL PART OF ANY SOCIAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">NETWORK, kinship related, friendship related, or otherwise. As with Alcoholics Anonymous, Parents Anonymous, etc., the practice-dating therapy group represents an important substitute for the kin family network and friendship networks which loveshy people lack. If <i class="calibre4"> EVERY</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">man <i class="calibre4"> HAD TO</i> introduce himself to women he did not know, it is highly likely that the marriage rate in American society would be a very great deal <i class="calibre4"> lower</i> than it actually is. Thus, therapists may be expecting more out of loveshy men than what is commonly expected of men generally here in the United States.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so I would suggest that it is both unreasonable and counterproductive to expect <i class="calibre4"> all</i> loveshy men to approach strange women as a hard, fast prerequisite for their being able to marry. The experiencing of marriage and family life is so crucial to socioemotional growth and maturation that to deny a man the opportunity to participate in these institutions simply because he cannot assert himself with strangers is positively immoral. In fact, psychoemotional inhibition in regard to the idea of approaching strange women may even have its positive albeit quite latent functions. For example, such inhibition may operate to assure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p548"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 517</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual fidelity throughout the duration of a marriage. In <i class="calibre4"> that</i> sense, loveshy men may actually make better-than-average husbands— <i class="calibre4">if</i> they can simply be accorded the sort of catalyst they require for becoming involved with a suitable female partner. Practice-dating therapy appears to be the best such catalyst yet to come along.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So if a man falls in love with and marries one of his assigned practice-dates, the mission of practice-dating therapy as far as that man is concerned must be considered to have been successfully accomplished. And if a severely loveshy man is patient and remains actively involved in practice-dating long enough, it is <i class="calibre4"> virtually inevitable</i> that he will eventually be assigned to someone with whom he will be able to progress towards marriage. It should please most traditional-minded therapists to learn that the large majority of loveshy men in therapy eventually manage as a direct result of the practice-dating experiences to have their heterosexual interaction anxieties fully extinguished. But for the 15 or so percent of severely loveshy men who do not respond to this anxiety-extinguishing process, it is nice to know that they <i class="calibre4"> will</i> inevitably meet and marry someone through their practice-dating participation <i class="calibre4"> if they simply "hang on" long enough. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Conclusions and Recommendations</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given its very high degree of documented effectiveness, it is very apparent that practice-dating as a therapeutic modality for loveshys needs to become far more widely available than it is at present. For example, no practice-dating programs have as yet become available outside the context of large university environments. Up to now the work that has been done on practice-dating therapy has focused entirely upon college and university students as clients.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think it is high time that practice-dating be made available to older loveshy clients. At this juncture in time this could be accomplished in three ways:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) State university practice-dating clinics could be expanded in such a way as to service severely loveshy adults from the surrounding community. This is one of many ways through which universities could to some extent give back to the local communities which support them. Advertisements could be placed on a frequent basis in local newspapers; posters could be affixed throughout the community. And the interest of local television and radio news and talk show people could easily be captured. Brief, 15-second ads could also be prepared for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p549"></a>518 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">local television networks. In short, it would require little time to build a large adult clientele. The only two problems would be (a) the necessity of waiting lists for prospective male clientele due to the dearth of interested women, and (b) securing the interest of a sufficient number of women who are still young enough to comfortably procreate children; i.e., ages 20 to 30.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) Individual therapists in private practice could easily become involved in the delivery of practice-dating therapy services.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in private practice already devote a substantial portion of their time to the admini-istration of group therapy sessions. Through advertising and through the obtaining of free publicity via television and radio news and talk shows, private practitioners could end up providing far greater and more lasting help to people than their traditional "talking cure" group therapy sessions ever could provide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) Public health clinics, health maintenance organizations, group medical practices, etc., have become widely available throughout virtually all parts of the United States. Practice-dating can be and should be one of the regular services which these various types of health clinics offer to the public.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, readers should not be left with the impression that practice-dating is as yet widely available even on university campuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, I think it can be considered highly tragic that this therapeutic modality is presently available on only a comparatively few campuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conventional shyness clinics patterned after the Zimbardo model and assertiveness training therapy are both far more widely available. There are essentially two key reasons for the dearth in the availability of practice-dating:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) Most clinical workers in the helping professions possess the basic human trait of <i class="calibre4"> laziness. </i> Let's face it. It is much easier for a clinician to conduct a form of therapy that merely involves conversation in his/her private office than it is for him/her to deal with such matters as waiting lists, advertising and publicity, assigning men and women to each other for meetings that are to take place outside the context of the therapy office, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Personally I do not believe that practice-dating needs to represent anymore laborious a task for a competent therapist than any of the more conventional therapies. It is certainly no more taxing than the operation of a shyness clinic (Zimbardo model). However, the initiating of a practice-dating program does require some guts and some sense of adventure on the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p550"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 519</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of the therapist. A therapist has got to have a <i class="calibre4"> non-shy,</i> innovative spirit in order for him/her to be willing to pursue practice-dating to the point of actually engineering and administering a program in it. (I think there is reason to believe that most therapists are themselves a bit on the shy side.) (2) There is little need for a practitioner to take risks when he/she can maintain a lucrative practice and get along well with his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her colleagues by following traditional therapeutic modalities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, most therapists in private practice do not wish to be conspicuous or in any way noticeable for being "different"</p>
<p class="calibre1">or innovative. Practice-dating is as yet somewhat of a nonconformist approach to therapy. And professional organizations composed of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychiatric social workers, all tend to be very much on the conservative side. Therapists involved in the administration of practice-dating clinics may fear the possibility of not receiving their fair share of referrals of new clients. The traditional folk wisdom in all psychotherapeutic fields is that dependency of the client upon the therapist must be discouraged at all costs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating is often misperceived as fostering dependency and as discouraging self-sufficiency. Thus, most psychotherapists like to <i class="calibre4"> "adjust" </i> to and work within the "status quo".</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, traditionally oriented psychotherapists (who are usually the ones with the power and influence) believe in stressing <i class="calibre4">adjustment</i> both for themselves as well as for their clients. In recent years the entire field of psychiatry has been soundly criticized for this. To be sure, adjustment of a person to his/her social environment is healthy up to a point. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> adjusting</i> to various forms of social pressure, oppression and injustice is <i class="calibre4"> not healthy. </i> In the Soviet Union political dissidents are often thrown into insane asylums under the pre-text that they are "mentally ill" because they disagree with "the system"</p>
<p class="calibre1">in some ways. Until quite recently American psychiatry dealt with homosexuals as "sick" individuals simply because they are different. Even today, young women who do not wish to stay home for thirty years and take care of the needs of a husband and a large brood of children are sometimes seen as being "sick"—particularly by fundamentalistically oriented religionists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The conventional therapist believes that loveshy men need to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"adjust" to the currently prevailing norms which prescribe the assertive role for men vis-a-vis women, and which prescribe that all young men must be able to handle ambiguity (practice-dating is a highly structured sort of program). The conventional therapist similarly believes that any</p>
