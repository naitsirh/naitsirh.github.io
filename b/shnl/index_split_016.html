<p class="calibre1">Myself, I'd even try being a homosexual. But even the thought of going to bed with a guy disgusts me. I don't think it's immoral or anything. It's just something that revolts me and there's no way I could bring myself to do it. But guys who can do it are sure as hell a lot better off than shy heterosexuals like me." (24-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">This feeling is quite commonplace among the ranks of severely loveshy men. Because the loveshy male lacks any social support systems, even the world of the homosexual often looks better than his own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to be happy and stable, all human beings require regular and active involvement in meaningful roles and relationships. Of course, not all homosexuals take an active part in the amenities that are available to them. There are loveshy homosexuals as well as loveshy heterosexuals, and the prevalence of such loveshyness may be no different amid the homosexual community than it is among heterosexuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another reason why heterosexual loveshy men often envy homosexuals is that the latter are permitted to play the <i class="calibre4"> passive role</i> in interpersonal relationships and in the game of seeking out a stable love mate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, the passive homosexual can still find love and love relationships quite in spite of his passivity. Much like a woman in the heterosexual community, the passive homosexual can simply go to a "gay" bar or a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gay" bath, or to some homosexual support group, and simply wait to be approached by potential lovers. He does not need to make the first (assertive) move himself. He is not constrained to take the initiative as a prerequisite for being accorded the right to have someone to love.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, just like a woman in the heterosexual community, the passive homosexual man can place himself in a "gay" bar, and he can keep rejecting and rejecting and rejecting potential lovers until a potential lover comes along who strikes his fancy.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, heterosexual loveshy men are not recognized as representing any kind of a social category or political force with important needs worth attending to. There may indeed be far, far more heterosexual loveshy males in America than there are homosexuals. Yet because heterosexual loveshys appear to be an <i class="calibre4"> invisible</i> group (because they create no conspicuous social embarrassments), their needs and their very existence normally goes totally ignored.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The very high incidence of frequent masturbation among the loveshys quite clearly suggests that even very severe loveshyness is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> associated with any fundamental inability to have an erection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, loveshyness does not appear to be related to impotence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. The verbal abuse had doubtless acted essentially as a <i class="calibre4"> self-esteem</i> <i class="calibre4">lowerer</i> rather than as a homosexual identity creator.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. And, of course, an obvious reason why shy heterosexual men envy homosexuals is that for the latter there is a <i class="calibre4"> congruence</i> between attitudes and wishes on the one hand, and behavior on the other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The homosexual has <i class="calibre4"> chosen</i> not to marry and/or associate on an intimate basis with women. The shy heterosexual man has <i class="calibre4"> not</i> chosen this sort of lifestyle and in fact hates it. Thus, the reasonably well adjusted homosexual enjoys free choiceâ€”something about which the shy heterosexual man can only dream.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness and the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Criminal Mind</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At first glance loveshyness and criminality would appear to be poles apart. But as is so often the case, things are seldom what they seem! Stanford Univeristy professor Philip Zimbardo became an expert on life behind prison walls long before he launched his well-known investigation into the shyness problems of univeristy students. And one of the particularly intriguing conclusions of his work was that many criminals are very shy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zimbardo sees shyness together with low social self-confidence and serious deficits in interpersonal skills as driving many people towards (and sometimes over) the brink of committing criminal acts. Crimes of violence both within and outside of the family, as well as rape, robbery, and political/religious extremism, are believed by an increasing number of criminologists to be due at least in part to a fundamental reticence about friendly, honest, open, sociable interaction. In fact, from the age of about eleven onward delinquent boys have been found by many researchers to have a very hard time making friends. And compared to non-delinquent boys, those running the criminal course tend to not even like very much the very few friends they do have.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most severely loveshy men have similarly grown up to truly feel that no one really gives a damn about them. And, of course, if a person genuinely feels that nobody cares about his human needs and feelings, it is but a short step for that person to renounce any thought about caring for the needs and feelings of the other human beings in his environment. "Since nobody has ever cared about me, why the hell should I give a damn about anybody?" This is the nutshell essence of the psychopathic way of thinking. It is a very dangerous way of thinking, and it often gives rise to serious criminal conduct.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intrigued with Dr. Zimbardo's thoughts on this matter, I decided to include some applicable questions on my own shyness questionnaire.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this chapter is to summarize my own findings on the 343</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a>344 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible relationship between loveshyness and the potential for criminality and/or violence.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Violent Fantasies</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each repondent: "Have you had fantasies during the past month in which you saw yourself as being very violent with some person or group?" Quite in spite of the fact that the loveshys were much more pacifistic and anti-war in their ideological belief systems than were the non-shys, it is most intriguing to note that fully 71 percent of the older loveshys and 66 percent of the younger ones answered <i class="calibre4"> "yes" </i> to this question! And it becomes all the more intriguing when it is observed that only 12 percent of the self-confident non-shy men similarly answered</p>
<p class="calibre1">"yes".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, with most of the loveshys these violent fantasies do not appear to be a recent thing. I asked each man to respond to this statement: "When I was a child between the ages of 10 and 15, I often had fantasies about taking violent revenge against some person or group."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And fully 89 percent of the older loveshy men along with 66 percent of the younger loveshys agreed that this had been true for them. In contrast, only 47 percent of the non-shys similarly indicated that it had been true for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Violent fantasies appear to have been much more common among both the loveshys and the non-shys during childhood than now. Nevertheless, the interview data clearly suggested that such violent fantasies had been a much more commonplace, everyday occurrence for the loveshys. The non-shys tended to have violent fantasies in response to stimulating crime and western movies, television programs, and contact sports (while involved in the role of either participant or observer). On the other hand, the loveshys never watched contact sports either on television or in person at stadiums. In addition, they tended to avoid crime and western programs because they found them "too unromantic". Unlike the non-shys, their violent fantasies tended to crop up on a near-daily basis in response to bullying from peers and punitive interaction from parents in the home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 22-year old loveshy man shared the following with me as an example of a frequent, quite violent fantasy:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was 14-years old my parents forced me to go to camp for eight weeks. And there was this kid there who kept throwing rocks at me. Whenever he saw me he immediately stooped down to pick up a rock to throw. Every day this kid just made my life more and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind 345</p>
<p class="calibre1">more miserable. I tried to get the counselors to put a stop to it. But their disciplinary action against this kid met with only limited success. Anyway, I got to the point where I was planning strategies to bludgeon him to death while he slept. I kept dreaming about how I would sneak into his cabin at 3 in the morning while he was asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd have a really big rockâ€”but not so big that I couldn't get a good grip on it. And I'd just hit him over the head as hard as I could as many times as I could. And then I'd sneak away. I kept thinking these things over and over, until just a few days before the eight weeks ended I actually had found the rock that I would use. And I kept it in my bed with me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the loveshys had frequent fantasies about how they would set fire to their parents' homes. These fantasies were all very much like the foregoing. The person saw himself sneaking into the garage at 3 o'clock in the morning and grabbing a container of gasoline which he would dump all over the living room and stairwells. These fire-setting fantasies were particularly commonplace among those loveshys who had received a great deal of corporal punishment at the hands of their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As indicated in chapter ten, most of the loveshys had suffered a tremendous amount of bullying at the hands of their peers as they were growing up. And this is doubtless a key reason why they developed social avoidance tendencies and learned to find social isolation less painful than the physical and psychological abuse they had to sustain whenever they were around age mates.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bullying</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In view of this history of having been severely and frequently bullied, I decided that it might prove interesting to ask each respondent about the extent to which <i class="calibre4"> he</i> had taken part in the bullying of others during the time when <i class="calibre4"> he</i> had been an elementary school child. And I think it is instructive to note that fully 100 percent of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> the older loveshys <i class="calibre4"> and</i> the younger loveshys claimed that they had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> taken any part in the bullying of anyone. In stark contrast, only 20 percent of the non-shy men claimed that they had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> bullied anyone when they were in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, these findings would appear to suggest two things: (1) the loveshys had been very violent in some of their fantasies, with most of this fantasy violence directed towards their persecutors. But in terms of <i class="calibre4"> actual behavior, </i> the loveshys had been far less violent and less cruel as children than the non-shys. Secondly (2), these findings would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>3 4 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear to suggest that "healthy" boyish development in American society quite commonly gives rise to quite a bit of cruelty and capricious violence against others. And, of course, this arbitrary and capricious bullying causes suffering which often leaves lifelong emotional scars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, having been the victim of so much violence and bullying throughout the formative years would be bound to have some impact upon one's thought processes. People who commit particularly bizarre, irrational crimes of violence are frequently those who had been quiet youngsters who never fought back and who always seemed to do what their teachers told them without overtly complaining. Criminologists have speculated that for some "Casper Milktoast" type personalities the pressures gradually build up over the years. And for some people with this type of personality the bubble eventually bursts and a particularly heinous, violent and bizarre crime ensues. Unfortunately, the problem for scientists is that they cannot as yet predict with any accuracy just exactly <i class="calibre4"> which</i> "Casper Milktoasts"  <i class="calibre4"> will</i> at some later time explode and become dangerously violent. Most "Casper Milktoasts"  <i class="calibre4"> never</i> become violent. They simply seethe away inside and gradually develop a host of psychoemotional and physical ailments in lieu of eventually exploding with violence towards others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Similarity to Child Abusers</p>
<p class="calibre1">The similarities between the backgrounds of the loveshy and those of certain violence-prone types are quite striking and deserve some comment. For example, consider what is known about men who severely batter and abuse their wives and/or children. Virtually all of the scores of research studies on family violence that were completed in the ten years from 1972 to 1982, point to the following five major antecedent factors differentiating violent husbands from nonviolent ones: (1) social isolation; (2) poor interpersonal/communicational finesse; (3) stress; (4) low self-esteem along with strong feelings of personal insecurity; and (5) an extensive history of having been the <i class="calibre4"> victim</i> of violence, especially vis-a-vis parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, in looking over the full range of data obtained for this research, it immediately becomes clear that loveshy men differ most strongly from the non-shy on just these five variables. First, most loveshy men traveled through life as isolates without any meaningful friendships or relationships with relatives and kin. Secondly, the loveshys tended to be conspicuously lacking in interpersonal/communicational finesse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirdly, lacking the emotional satisfactions which most people enjoy <i class="calibre4">(and which loveshy men dearly want to have), </i> they are under quite a bit of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 4 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">stress and emotional turmoil. And as will be documented in chapter fifteen, this turmoil is reflected in a wide range of medical and emotional symptoms. The loveshy obviously possess far lower self-esteem than the non-shy. And finally, the loveshy had received far more abuse at the hands of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> parents and peers than had the non-shy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, we must be careful about drawing unwarrented conclusions from this. For example, studies have shown that violent husbands tend to date and to marry rather early in life. In essence, unlike the loveshy (who <i class="calibre4"> had wanted</i> to marry quite early in life), violence-prone men tend not to be without female companionship for periods of any significant length. They may not be as relaxed, flexible and sociable vis-a-vis women as are most healthy men. But they quite clearly are not as disadvantaged in these areas as are the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the loveshy entertain many more violent fantasies than do the non-shy. But as yet no conclusions of any predictive value can be drawn as to whether any particular loveshy man will become violent at some later time in his life. For the loveshy the story seems to be one of <i class="calibre4"> dreaming and not doing. </i> And this would appear to apply as much to violence as it does to manifesting the more constructive emotions such as loving and asserting oneself vis-a-vis persons of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Psychopathy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to their fantasies about violently acting out, another attribute which loveshy men seem to share in common with incarcerated criminals is that of psychopathy. As indicated before, psychopathy rests upon a deep-seated feeling that no one really gives a damn about what is likely to happen to one. And, of course, if a man genuinely believes that no one really cares about <i class="calibre4"> his</i> needs and feelings, it is only one small step for him to arrive at the conviction that there is similarly little or no need for him to "give a damn" about the needs and feelings of others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard I asked each of my respondents to react to the statement: "No one is going to care much about what happens to you when you come right down to it." And only 7 percent of the self-confident non-shys felt impelled to agree. In stark contrast, fully 73 percent of the older loveshys together with 49 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with this statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, many of the loveshys were quite alienated from relatives, kin and family. And I think that may constitute a major reason for their widespread tendency to agree with the above statement. In essence, the loveshys were not only isolated from the standpoint of being without chosen friendships, but they also felt very little confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>3 4 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">in any of their blood relatives as help sources. To reiterate an earlier finding,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys and only 9 percent of the younger ones had had the benefit during their formative years of three or four adult relatives other than parents to whom they could have turned for help and emotional support. In stark contrast, fully 59 percent of the self-confident non-shys had had the benefit of the help and emotional support of three or more blood relatives other than parents. In a related question, 87 percent of the older loveshys could not name a single blood relative (apart from parents with whom very few of them had enjoyed good relationships) upon whom they could count for help and emotional support. This was also the case for 68 percent of the younger loveshys. But among the self-confident non-shys, only 27 percent were incapable of naming any names.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the presence of certain psychopathic attitudes is not likely to eventuate in serious criminal or violent conduct unless a host of other factors are also present in a person's life. Most (but certainly far from all) criminal activity requires at least some ability to meet and to informally socialize with other procriminalistic types. The loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">"people-phobia" had evidently served well to insulate them from any opportunity to informally associate with those who might have made criminal activity seem like an appropriate or propitious course of action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, just as loveshyness had served well to insulate its victims from desirable "growth facilitating" experiences, it had also served equally well to insulate them from any opportunity to engage in the large majority of different forms of criminal deviance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshys I studied read quite a bit; and all of them gave evidence of being rather sedentary, "low energy", "stay-at-home"</p>
<p class="calibre1">type people. Hence, it is possible that like most people who read quite a bit, the loveshys had developed a life philosophy that militated against psychopathic wrongdoing. Intellectual and spiritual awareness can both do much to counter psychopathic tendencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shoplifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">When it comes to nonviolent crimes which can be committed without the benefit and cooperation of any accomplices, shoplifting would appear to fit the bill very nicely. Yet I was somewhat surprised to find that the loveshys had been <i class="calibre4"> less</i> involved than the non-shys in this sort of activity. For generations now it has been argued that kleptomania is a reflection of a search for love; and that the loveless often steal <i class="calibre4"> things</i> as a substitute for the lack in their lives of <i class="calibre4"> real love. </i> Of course, it requires some amount of "real nerve" in order to engage in shoplifting. And this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 4 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">might explain the fact that the loveshys were less likely than the non-shys to have engaged in it. Another factor of some importance might be the fact that most shoplifting among teenagers is done as part of a groupâ€”in an effort to "prove" masculinity, courage and daringâ€”rather than as an effort to own things as "love substitutes".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In any case, 19 percent of the non-shys claimed that they had</p>
<p class="calibre1">"sometimes" or "frequently" engaged in shoplifting. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> (nobody) among either the older or the younger loveshys had</p>
<p class="calibre1">"sometimes" or "frequently" engaged in shoplifting. On the other side of the ledger, 71 percent of the older loveshys had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> engaged in shoplifting. In contrast, only 36 percent of the self-confident non-shy men claimed to have <i class="calibre4"> never</i> engaged in shoplifting. Among the younger loveshys, 59 percent claimed to have never engaged in shoplifting.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Marijuana Use</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most young people who experiment at parties with marijuana never got into any legal difficulties as a result. Nevertheless, frequent or regular use of marijuana is believed by many social scientists to reflect a sort of crime-prone psychopathy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each of my respondents to indicate the approximate number of times during the past two months that he had used marijuana. And 88 percent of the older loveshys together with 71 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they had not used it at all. By contrast, only 34</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shys were non-users. Indeed, on the other side of the ledger fully 58 percent of the non-shy men had used marijuana <i class="calibre4"> five or more times</i> within the two months prior to the interview.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">None</i> of the older loveshys had used it that often, and only 14 percent of the younger loveshys had used it five or more times within the two month period immediately prior to the interview.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, marijuana smoking is a <i class="calibre4"> highly social</i> brand of nonconformity. Everything else being equal, it would not ordinarily be expected that relatively isolated, lonely people would become involved in much marijuana use. Friendship networks are normally needed in order for people to know where to go in order to safely purchase marijuana. In addition, direct involvement in friendship groups is usually needed as a catalyst for providing the impetus and social facilitation necessary to the promotion of marijuana experimentation. Loveshy people tend to have very few if any informal friendships. As such they appear to lack the kinds of opportunities and social supports that serve to promote experimentation with drugs.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a>350 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several studies published during the late 1970s showed that among university students there is a high positive correlation between sexual involvement and experimentation with marijuana. Students who were involved in premarital sexual relationships were, in essence, found to be far more likely than those not so involved to have tried marijuana.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The main reason why these two types of activity tend to be found together among young people is that both seem to be associated with a spirit of adventure, with high sociability, and with a willingness to take risks. Loveshy men, as this book quite clearly documents, tend to be bogged down by inertia. As a group they tend to be anything but adventurous. Indeed, they are extremely fearful and reticent about taking risks, even when the risks are in their best interests and are very mild in nature. And in spite of the loveshys' intellectual desires to be sociable, it is clear that they are anything but sociable. Hence, their comparative absence from the drug scene can be considered quite understandable and expected.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Alcohol Use</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hans Eysenck found that virtually all of the alcoholics he studied were high on inborn introversion and high on inborn emotionality (low anxiety threshold). In short, he found that alcoholics tend to possess essentially the same type of inborn temperament as do the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason I was quite surprised to find that the loveshy men who were studied for this book were significantly <i class="calibre4"> less likely</i> than the self-confident non-shys to be heavily into alcohol use. For example, I asked each man interviewed to provide me with an estimate of the number of drinks containing beer, wine or liquor, he usually consumes during a typical week. The average for the older loveshys turned out to be 4.83.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, the self-confident non-shys estimated that they took 9.21</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinks during the course of a typical week. The younger (univeristy age) loveshys were in between with an average of 8.43 drinks per week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the data another way, 79 percent of the non-shy men imbibed four or more alcoholic drinks per week, whereas among the older loveshys only 33 percent imbibed that many. The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was 50 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I further asked each man to respond to the statement: "I never or very rarely become intoxicated from too much drinking." And only 21</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shys indicated that this was true for themselves, compared to fully 72 percent of the older loveshys and 43</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 5 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, these findings do not assure that over the long haul the loveshys might not be more vulnerable to alcoholism or to undisciplined drinking binges than the non-shys. Nevertheless, there is a strong suggestion here that as of the time the data were collected the loveshys were engaged in a good deal less undisciplined drinking behavior than the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would suggest that a key reason behind these findings is that for most people drinking is a <i class="calibre4"> sociable</i> sort of behavior. Inasmuch as the loveshy were "people-phobic" and certainly not very sociable, their lower average intake of alcoholic beverages can probably best be explained in exactly the same way that their lower level of marijuana use was explained.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the loveshys simply do not have any friends with whom to drink. And since there is no one around to facilitate them in social, convivial, recreational drinking, the drinking in which the loveshys do partake is probably quite likely to be done strictly on their own. And this is exactly what I found to be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked: "Do you ever drink alcoholic beverages <i class="calibre4"> alone?" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And 32 percent of the older loveshys answered <i class="calibre4"> "yes, frequently", compared to zero percent</i> of the self-confident non-shys. The younger loveshys were in between with 14 percent admitting that they <i class="calibre4"> "frequently" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">drink all by themselves. In fact, when those respondents who said "yes, they <i class="calibre4"> occasionally</i> drink alone" were added to those who said "yes, they <i class="calibre4">frequently</i> drink alone", the differences between the loveshys and the non-shys remained rather substantial: 13 percent of the non-shys frequently or occasionally drank alone, compared to 44 percent of the two groups of loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another interesting difference of less serious significance was the fact that a majority of the loveshy men had never developed a taste for beer. Only 4 percent of the loveshys ever drank beer at all, whereas beer was the major alcoholic staple among the ranks of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the older and the younger loveshy men tended to prefer mixed coctails, brandy or bourbon with ginger ale, and various wines. Further, the loveshy men in stark contrast to the non-shys almost never drank in bars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, beer drinking has long been integral to masculine culture here in the United States. The loveshys (1) had long rejected traditional masculine culture with all of its football and beer drinking, and (2) they were in most cases lonely isolates of poor social self-confidence. Especially because of the second factor, they could not be expected to have developed a taste for beer. Of course, this is not to intimate that men who choose beer are necessarily better off from the standpoint of health and safety implications than men who choose other forms of alcoholic beverages. Beer drinking men from college age onward often overdo</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>352 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">things to the point of endangering both themselves and others. However, there are some obvious negative signs of a very different nature in the drinking patterns of the loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a very long time research on alcoholic beverage consumption has shown that people who drink alone in their homes or apartments tend to be substantially more likely to eventually become alcoholic than those who do not drink alone. The fact that the loveshy men had many more severe frustrations and anxieties in their lives (and the fact that their lives were obviously a great deal less happy and satisfying) than did the non-shys, would appear to render them especially vulnerable to eventual alcoholism. Again, Hans Eysenck found that virtually all of the alcoholics he studied were both highly introverted and very low on inborn anxiety threshold. These same characteristics apply on an equally universal basis to severely loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the reader should remain mindful of the fact that as of the time the data were obtained only 7 percent of the self-confident non-shy men were averaging "one or no alcoholic drinks per week". Among the loveshy men, on the other hand, 44 percent of the older ones and 36 percent of the younger ones were averaging "one or no drinks per week".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the future it would be both interesting and useful if some researcher would follow up a large number of loveshy men, and see just how many of them eventually do become alcoholics. For the moment, at least, the question of whether or not loveshyness leads to problem drinking patterns will have to remain unanswered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that loveshy men (1) are not peer group oriented, and (2) the fact that they never had any need to overtly manifest or "prove"</p>
<p class="calibre1">their masculinity in the company of others, may have served well to keep them free from the dangers and pitfalls of problem drinking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it has often been said that melancholic men (inhibited men with low native anxiety thresholds) tend to be prone towards <i class="calibre4"> using</i> alcohol as a solvent for their psychoemotional inhibitions. The idea, of course, is that through "getting stoned" many very inhibited people finally become capable of doing or saying things in the company of others which they would really like to do or sayâ€”but which they do not have the nerve to do or say in the sober state.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The data which I collected from the loveshy men who were interviewed for this book has strongly convinced me that <i class="calibre4"> all melancholic men</i> <i class="calibre4">are not alike. </i> Simply put, it would appear that the defense system of loveshy melancholies is far too strong and rigidly intractable to permit <i class="calibre4">using</i> alcohol as a tool for dissolving inhibitions. Just as most of the loveshy men would be too fearful and nervous to permit a hypnotist to hypnotize away their inhibitions, for the <i class="calibre4"> same reason</i> they would be too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 5 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">fearful and nervous to permit alcohol to dissolve away any of their inhibitions. In essence, loveshy men would appear to be a special type of melancholic. Whereas the typical alcoholic usually finds a sense of relief in using alcohol as an inhibition solvent, the loveshy melancholic seems to tremendously fear <i class="calibre4"> losing control. </i> And this great fear of loss of control may well be what keeps most loveshys from ever becoming involved in problem drinking or in alcoholism. Most of them drink on occasion (and alone) only because they "enjoy the taste" of their favorite coctails or wine. Most loveshy men seem to dislike the "feeling" which the imbibing of more than two or three drinks creates. In essence, when loveshy men drink they drink for the taste and not for the feeling. Non-shys, on the other hand, drink for "friendly sociability", and they often look forward to "that light-headed feeling".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Staring and Following</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In surveying the full range of findings that were uncovered by this study, there appears to be only one area wherein some of the loveshys seem to have gotten themselves into a sort of trouble that entails legal implications. This area pertains to compulsive staring and following behavior. As a case in point I asked each man to respond to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There have been times when I have stared for long periods at a girl whom I have found very attractive; but as soon as she would look in my direction I would immediately look away."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 97 percent of the older loveshy men together with 71 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that this had been "true" for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast, only 11 percent of the self-confident non-shy men indicated that this statement was true for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the more important question is that of whether or not this behavior had ever led to any negative confrontations or disciplinary action. And here, fully 42 percent of the older loveshys together with 31 percent of the younger loveshys did admit that they had at one time or another gotten into trouble because of their inability to stop themselves from staring at a girl or girls whom they had found very attractive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, only 9 percent of the self-confident non-shys had ever gotten into any trouble due to this sort of behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point the reader may be somewhat confused because it obviously requires some amount of "nerve" or non-shyness in order to engage in this sort of compulsive behavior. Of course, most non-shy men never had any need to engage in this sort of compulsive behavior;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>354 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could <i class="calibre4"> interact and communicate</i> face-to-face with the women of their choosing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While the loveshys were engaging in this staring behavior, as well as during periods between episodes, they would fantasize and daydream very deeply and long about the particular girl with whom they were uncontrollably infatuated and towards whom they had felt impelled to stare. Their fantasies made her out to be a sort of "saint"â€”someone who would somehow <i class="calibre4"> understand</i> them and their loveshyness problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Many of the loveshys had remained incredibly "innocent" in this regard until their early 30s, when some of them started to become quite cynical.) Many of the loveshys had fantasized about how this girl of their dreams would really like to meet them, and about how this "angel" of a girl would one day find a way to assume the assertive role in opening up a friendship with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contributing to the compulsive quality of this staring behavior and greatly enhancing the strength of the compulsion to stare, was the fact that these loveshy men would often spend many hours of each day, sometimes over a two or three month period of time, daydreaming about the girl in whom they held the infatuation. Of course, the problem was that any time the girl actually looked as though she might be ready to make an actual move towards the loveshy man doing the staring, that loveshy man would instantly become overwhelmed with fright. And he would either very quickly walk or run away, or he would turn his head in a different direction. Much of this staring behavior had occurred in university libraries. And frequently the loveshy man would respond to a girl's gesture by immediately looking back down at his bookâ€”the very second the girl began to look his way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, this sort of behavior had been very unnerving and upsetting to most of the women who had been victimized by it. Most people tend to fear that which they do not understand. And most of the victimized women found this staring (then looking or running away) behavior to be exceedingly strange. And they did not know how to respond to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">American society does not provide its young women with the type of behavioral repertoire that is required for correctly interpreting and responding to this sort of extremely loveshy male behavior. Consequently, some of the stared at women in time became quite worried and even frightened. And they often went to the police or to the Dean of Women, or to some other authority figure (e.g., campus security) to try to get something done about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally these romantic compulsions of loveshy men can become extremely frightening and even traumatic to some women. Of course, the women selected are almost always quite attractiveâ€”with the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind 355</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual "long hair and pretty face" that is strongly preferred by most loveshy men. Attractive women normally have a good sized network of informal friendships. In addition, they are usually above average in assertiveness compared to the majority of women. This represents an interesting paradox because while the loveshy male usually fantasizes that by some magic stroke the girl will become friendly and loving towards him, he almost always dreams his ideal love-object to be a very beautiful but shy and inhibited, quite socially unpopular personâ€”just like himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, in reality feminine beauty and low social self-confidence would appear to be well nigh mutually exclusive categories. Very rare indeed is the beautiful girl who is not also very sociable and very socially self-confident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because they have a good sized network of close friends, most of these stared at women have a good many people towards whom they can turn when they are faced with anxiety-provoking incidents, such as that of almost constantly being stared at by some seemingly "weird"</p>
<p class="calibre1">young man who is a total stranger to them. Of course, the women selected for this unwanted attention usually have no way of knowing that the young man who is doing the staring is about as "harmless as they come". A woman's lack of knowledge of a young man and her total lack of understanding about his behavior will almost always render her subject to serious emotional trauma when and if, in addition to staring, he <i class="calibre4"> also begins following her. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to react to the statement: "There have been times when I have followed a girl whom I have found attractive all over campus or town; but I have looked away whenever she looked in my direction, and I have not said anything to her because of my extreme shyness."  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident non-shys indicated "yes" to this statement. On the other hand, 44 percent of the older loveshys along with 35 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that the statement was "true" for themselves. Moreover, fully 19 percent (almost one-fifth) of the older loveshys together with 13 percent of the younger loveshys agreed that they had "gotten into trouble" at one time or another as a result of an uncontrollable urge to follow a girl all over campus or all over town without ever saying anything to her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The trouble that ensued was variable, but always extremely painful to the loveshy man who, again, had fantasized his love-object to be a kind of goddess and saint who would somehow "understand" him. One young man who had grown up in a small community in Alabama, had been made to spend a night in jail as a penalty for his persistence in following a girl around. He had received several warnings to stop following her; but he couldn't bring himself to stop. Several other loveshys had suffered bruises and welts as a result of having been accosted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a>3 5 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">by male friends or brothers of the attractive girl whom they had been staring at and/or following. However, the most commonplace sort of</p>
<p class="calibre1">"trouble" seemed to be that of (1) disciplinary action at their university, or (2) being terminated from their employment for "sexually harassing women".</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 36-year old loveshy man told the following story about how he had been suspended from college and sent home by the disciplinary dean when he was a sophomore at his undergraduate university.</p>
<p class="calibre1">1 grew up here in Los Angeles, but I wanted to attend the University of Montana because I wanted to see what life was like outside this city. I didn't get along very well with my folks. And I had heard that the people up in Montana were supposed to be much friendlier than those here in L.A. I mean, I really thought that if the people were really friendlier as everybody was saying, then I should be able to get some girl to come after me. You know what I mean? Like I figured that sooner or later some girl up there would make friends with me, and everything would be okey from that time onward. I could get married if I could get the right, friendly girl to make friends with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, my father was a successful accountant, and he had enough money to pay the out-of-state tuition up there in Montana. And I was really looking forward to moving up there because, like, I went to high school in Canoga Park. And Valley girls are just all shit! I mean, they're just not romantic. I wanted to get a girl as fast as I could who would be really romantic and beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I got up there I was really bitterly disappointed. I mean the countryside was nice enough. I used to enjoy taking long drives all over. But everybody ignored me. And even though my father was paying for a double room for me in the dormitory, by March of my freshman year I ended up having the room all to myself. And in my sophomore year my roommate moved out by Columbus Day weekend, and they didn't assign me anyone else. So I had my double room all to myself all during my sophomore year. And I used to dream a lot about how nice it would be if I could get a girl in there with me. I had the place all to myself, and it would have been so beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, it took until my sophomore year until I spotted someone who I really liked. This girl was a freshman, and she had the most beautiful long, dark hair you ever saw. She had a really beautiful face with a kind of ethereal look to it, like she had come from some other world. And she had blue eyes and narrow, thin legs. I mean she was really perfect! But I had never dated anyone in my life, and I knew that I couldn't just go up to her and say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 5 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">So pretty soon I began making mental notes of the times of day and places around campus where I saw her. I spotted her a lot in the library; and I couldn't take my eyes off of her. I couldn't concentrate on a thing. I'd sometimes have my book turned to the same page for hours on end whenever she was there. And by Thanksgiving I was following her all over the campus. Several times she looked like she was going to approach me. And I got so frightened I had to go to the bathroom. I mean, I was just shaking all over. I knew I wanted her more badly than life itself. But I would shake all over whenever she would turn around and look my way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, one day this big, tough-looking adult accosted me as I was peering through a first floor window at her where she was attending a math class. The guy showed me a police badge. And I was really shocked. I mean this guy looked like an overgrown, overaged football player. He wasn't wearing a uniform or anything. Anyway, he asked for my student 'ID', and took down all the information on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And he said I'd soon be hearing from the dean.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I got called into the dean's office the next morning. In fact, he made me cut my English class in order to come because he said it was extremely important. Anyway, after I got there he started asking me all these questions I was just too shy to answer. And then he said he was going to send me to the university psychiatrist; and that if I was caught anywhere near this girl again I would be suspended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, my insides felt like they were being torn out. I mean I realized that there wasn't any way I could really ignore this girl. I had been spending 24 hours a day dreaming about her, and she was a part of me. There was no way I could just forget she existed. I mean, just one look at her made my day; although it also made my heart beat extremely hard, and it made me feel almost out of breath just to look at her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I went to the shrink because I had to. And he was just as bad as the shrinks my father had sent me to back home. In fact, I'd say he was even worse because he was extremely condescending towards me. And he said he couldn't do anything about getting me introduced to any girls. I mean if he wouldn't make any effort to introduce me to any girls, I figured he was worthless to me. I mean, what good is any psychiatrist unless they give you what you need? I needed a girl I could love. And whenever I asked him to introduce me to some girls all he ever did was ask me what my feelings were about his refusal to do so! Isn't that the stupidest goddam thing you ever heard?! Psychiatrists are all for the shits! I never met a one I really liked because they don't want to give you the kind of help you really need!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a>358 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, to make a long story short, I was accosted again by this plainclothesman about a week before Christmas vacation was scheduled to begin. There was no way I could make like this girl didn't exist on the same campus with me. And the dean suspended me for it. I lost a whole year of work because of this incident. It was really the most painful time of my life because no one would give me the help I really needed. When I got home my parents were more hateful of me than ever. My father sent me to this expensive shrink in Santa Monica. And it was the same old shit. This time the psychiatrist was a nice guy. But just like all the others he wouldn't do anything to really help me except for one thing. He did put me into a group therapy situation where there were some girls. But most of them were too old for me. And the one girl there of my age was just too damned hostile."</p>
<p class="calibre1">This case is not dissimilar from many others uncovered by this research. In fact, it can be considered quite representative in a good many ways of the plight of the loveshy. Of course, this is notwithstand-ing the fact that as a result of their own plight and internal turmoil the loveshy occasionally (albeit unintentionally) cause others considerable turmoil and suffering, as in the case of the girl in the above interview who had been followed and stared at interminably. As I have indicated, people tend to most strongly fear those things, situations <i class="calibre4"> or people</i> which they do not understand. Thus, it would appear that some education at both the high school and the college/university level might be in order in terms of rendering young women aware of the motivational psychology of loveshy men. Young women need to be advised that loveshy men are not in any way dangerous, despite the fact that loveshy following and staring behavior appears to be inordinately "weird".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadly, the man in the above case interview is now 36 years of age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet he is presently just as virginal and just as inexperienced with women as he had been during his University of Montana days. The psychotherapeutic treatment that had been foisted on him over the years did virtually nothing to effect any kind of a solution to his problem of chronic, intractable loveshyness vis-a-vis women. Thousands of dollars had been spent on psychotherapy for him. But the psychotherapeutic technologies employed in dealing with him had all proved totally refractory to his needs. This is an issue of the most profound importance. And it along with a viable, workable remedy will be introduced and detailed in part three of this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another behavior which got some of the loveshy men into trouble was that of writing love-letters to a girl with whom they had become infatuated. For example, a loveshy man might use various means to find out a girl's name. A few of the men spoke about how they had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 5 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">sneaked up to a girl's books and papers in the library while she was away from her study table or on a break in the bathroom. After receiving the love letters these shy men had written, the women often became very nervous and upset. Often they would respond by going to the police or the dean or to some other legal source about the matter. This outcome served to further disillusion many of the loveshy men about women. Indeed, this type of (to them) hostile response caused many of the loveshy men to become all the more lethargic about doing anything constructive to remedy their loveshyness situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One loveshy man had been fired, and another had been called on the carpet at work, because of love letters which they had surreptitiously sneaked onto the desks or lockers of young women employees in whom they had been infatuated. In both cases the young woman had responded by taking these innocent love letters to the boss. Both women had evidently been quite nervous about the letters because they had had no acquaintanceship with the young man at all. They didn't even know who he was. Again, the very hostile, punishing response on the part of these women had proved quite traumatic to the loveshy men. It made them more fearful of women than ever, and it served to disillusion them all the more strongly about their chances of ever being able to secure meaningful female companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Six of the men interviewed had initially gotten into trouble for following women as early as their high school years. Again, this suggests that the grosser symptoms of loveshyness often manifest themselves early enough and conspicuously enough for appropriate interventive methods to be pursued. Therapeutic interventive methods are not pursued because the tools in the traditional psychiatric armentarium are simply not suited to the task at hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologists and psychiatrists continue to quite wrongly assume that their methods only "seem" ineffective, and that "in time" the loveshy man will improveâ€”"when he is ready"â€”if he continues seeing a therapist year after year. Because of legal difficulties and many highly anxiety-provoking, traumatic incidents precipitated by women who had been the victims of this staring and following behavior, most loveshy men do eventually cease their following and their staring activityâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">although it is far from easy for them to do so. But even though the loveshy man no longer creates problems for his community as a result of his following and staring behavior, he continues to pose a profoundly unhappy problem to himself. And his community simply ignores him and passes him off as "some kind of weirdo".</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, none of the foregoing is intended to imply that staring and following behavior automatically ceases after it has been punished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the men studied who had gotten into trouble for their staring or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>3 6 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">following behavior, 62 percent had gotten in trouble a second time as a result of staring at or following a <i class="calibre4"> different</i> girl. And 38 percent had gotten into trouble yet a third time. Usually anywhere from four months to a year will pass between infatuations that are so strong that they precipitate following or staring behavior. The needs of many of the loveshy men appear to be so strong that they outweight both rational caution as well as fears and anxieties pertinent to hostile confrontations vis-avis the girl at whom they had been staring or following.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because it is easier to hide as well as to deny, the recidivism rate for staring behavior is much higher than it is for following behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the older loveshy respondents admitted that even now they occasionally find themselves repeatedly staring at a certain girl whom they find attractive. One university man brought a movie camera on campus and hid himself behind windows, shrubs and doorways where he filmed the object of his intense infatuation as she walked by presum-ably unaware of what was happening. Doing this kept this loveshy man from making a fearful nuisance of himself and getting himself into additional serious difficulties. Even among those loveshys who are now in their 40s, the urge to stare occasionally overwhelms them, and they give in to it quite in spite of the risks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Hinkley Case</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is difficult not to notice the similarity between the psychology of the loveshy men studied for this research, and that of John Hinkley, the then 25-year old man who tried to assinate President Reagan. Hinkley had been obsessed with fantasies about youthful movie star Jodie Foster. And these fantasies eventually led him to the bizarre conclusion that he could somehow favorably impress the object of his infatuation with an act that would immediately gain him worldwide and infamous notoriety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, there is considerable evidence that John Hinkley might have been a loveshy young man, as per the criteria for loveshyness which I delineated at the outset of chapter five. For example, Hinkley had never dated at all while he was in high school. In fact, according to his parents (interviewed on ABC News Magazine "20/20"), Hinkley had long wanted to have a girl friend; but he had never made any effort to actually interact socially with girls, or to date. According to Hinkley's parents, their son had been a social isolate from the eighth grade onward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think it should be stressed that none of the loveshys studied for this book had ever had the interest and fascination with guns that Hinkley had. Indeed, there seemed to be no interest in guns and firearms at all among any of the 300 loveshy men whom I interviewed. In contrast,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a>LoveShyness and the Criminal Mind  3 6 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">a good-sized minority of the self-confident non-shys did have some degree of interest in such activities as riflery and hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the obsessions and compulsions which the loveshy men steadfastly maintained for women who struck their esthetic fancy could be roughly compared to those of John Hinkley. Hinkley had been so thoroughly obsessed with thoughts of Jodie Foster that he could scarcely concentrate on anything else. And so it was with the loveshy men who could not bring themselves to stop their compulsive staring at or following the objects of their infatuation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was another interesting similarity worth mentioning. Hinkley's fantasy that shooting President Reagan would somehow cause Jodie Foster to like him could be compared to the equally improbable (albeit vastly less dangerous) fantasy that the women who were followed or stared at would somehow be charmed enough to magically endeavor to initiate a romantic friendship without causing any anxiety feelings (to the loveshy man) while in the process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so (1) obsessions and (2) compulsions with respect to beautiful women combined with (3) a psychoemotional inability to relate in any meaningful way to <i class="calibre4"> available</i> women, all seem to present a series of common denominators between the Hinkley case and the cases of many of the loveshy men who were studied for this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Difficulties Concentrating</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The obsessions of the loveshy burn and waste away a tremendous amount of psychic energy that could be used for constructive purposes if the loveshy could be successfully helped towards the attaining of their goal of an attractive women who would love them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Obsessive and compulsive thoughts, most of which pertain to their deprivation of female companionship and love, do much to prevent loveshys from concentrating their energies upon constructive activities and endeavors. For example I asked each respondent: "Do you have trouble concentrating while reading or studying?" And 84 percent of the older loveshys along with 62 percent of the younger ones said "yes". In contrast, only 6 percent of the self-confident non-shys admitted to having serious difficulties with concentration while reading or studying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally some of the loveshys suffered from obsessive thoughts even at times when they were engaged in recreational activities. For example, one man comments:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes like when I'm at a movie I won't be able to concentrate because I'll have these thoughts that I just can't allow myself to forget. Sometimes these thoughts aren't even really important, ,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>3 6 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">although other times I'll want to remember them for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I always carry paper and pen with me no matter where I go. Like when I'm watching a movie I'll be able to concentrate on things better if I simply write down my thoughtâ€”even if it's an unimportant thought. And so I write it down. And then the movie will remind me of some other idea. And again I won't be able to concentrate and enjoy the film until I write it down. I have over 3,000 note cards with these ideas on them. I keep them in a disorganized mess, and I never look at them. But I just couldn't throw them out because at one time or another I just couldn't concentrate on something until I wrote down an idea on one of the cards." (50-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final illustration of some of the problems created by obsessive thoughts, consider the following interview excerpt:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes something will happen that will make me forget what I was thinking of. I really hate more than anything to forget what I was thinking of. And sometimes I'm in mental turmoil for a long time whenever this happens, unless I can make the thought come back to me. Like if I forget a thought while I'm listening to a lecture or watching a movie, I just won't be able to concentrate for the rest of the presentation. I get so upset that I almost cry when this happens. That's why I become so upset if somebody knocks on my door, and the knocking causes me to forget what I was thinking. That can really ruin my whole eveningâ€”unless I get lucky and I can remember what it was I had been thinking of. (24-year old loveshy man.)</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Medical Symptoms and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most fascinating parts of my research on loveshyness dealt with the issue of medical symptomology. Few areas in the study of shyness are frought with more myths than this one. The typical psychologist often takes for granted the idea that psychosomatic symptoms are a consequence of shyness; and that once shyness symptoms are cured all of the various medical problems from which a shy person suffers will just naturally go away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, the data revealed by my research strongly suggest that <i class="calibre4">certain</i> medical symptoms may have a major bearing upon the creation and the maintenance of severe and pathological degrees of shyness. Of course, no one factor or set of factors will ever prove sufficient to cause severe loveshyness in males. Severe loveshyness is caused and maintained by many factors operating in synergistic interaction with one another. Medical factors now appear to be an important part of this synergy of causative factors. And it is the purpose of this chapter to pinpoint just exactly which medical factors may be important in cases of incipient as well as chronic loveshyness. Additionally, this chapter will provide the reader with further clues as to how to spot the pathologically loveshy man of the future while he is still in the earliest years of his elementary school career.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All respondents were asked some fifty different questions about their health and about various kinds of symptoms that are often thought of as "psychosomatic" in nature. I had originally hypothesized that loveshy men would be far more likely than non-shy men to have suffered from virtually any and all of the symptoms asked about. However, it turned out that such was not the case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3 6 3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>364 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Headaches</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, 23 percent of the older loveshy men indicated that they suffered from frequent headaches. The exact same figure of 23</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent also obtained for the younger loveshys. And among the self-confident non-shy men 21 percent said that they suffered from frequent headaches. Quite clearly the difference between 21 percent and 23 percent is insignificant; and indeed this difference could easily have occurred by chance. Simply put, loveshys are no more likely than non-shys to suffer from headaches. And by the way, headaches are probably the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"number one" psychosomatic symptom prevalent in America today!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Backaches and Back Trouble</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Backaches and back trouble cost American business and industry more money each year than any other type of medical problem except for alcoholism and headaches. The cost of this problem in lost wages and in absenteeism is staggering. And yet among the three groups of men studied for this book, back trouble was not very commonplace at all. Only 5 percent of the older loveshys together with 3 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they had ever had any problems with their back. In contrast, 8 percent of the self-confident non-shys had occasionally experienced one problem or another with their backs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, it would appear that back trouble may represent one medical problem to which loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> less</i> vulnerable than self-confident non-shy men. I would speculate that the major reason for this lower level of vulnerability probably has something to do with the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-standing disenchantment with participation in any type of "rough and tumble" sports. In avoiding typically "masculine" activities the loveshys were, in essence, protecting themselves against possible back injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bedwetting</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lately there has been a good deal of discussion about parents mishandling the enuresis (bedwetting) problem in young children, and creating pathological degrees of self-consciousness and low self-esteem in the process. Especially since little boys are a good deal more vulnerable than little girls to the enuresis problem, I decided to ask each of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 6 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">respondents whether or not he had wet his bed at any time <i class="calibre4"> after his</i> <i class="calibre4">fourth birthday. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, the findings were somewhat surprising. Fully 55 percent of the highly self-confident non-shys admitted that they <i class="calibre4"> had</i> wet their beds subsequent to reaching the age of four. The analogous figures for the two loveshy groups were 54 percent for the younger loveshys and 49</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent for the older loveshys. In essence, if these data are true it appears that loveshy males may have actually been slightly <i class="calibre4"> less</i> likely to have wet their beds during early childhood than self-confident non-shy males!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Weight Problems</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On weight problems there was similarly very little difference among the three different groups of men studied. Four percent of the self-confident non-shy men complained of being overweight, compared to 5 percent of the younger loveshy men. Among the older loveshys the figure was a bit higherâ€”8 percent. Nevertheless, the message remains quite clear that even among pathologically loveshy men in their late 30s and 40s, less than one out of every twelve suffers from any kind of a weight problem. More succinctly, weight problems in men do not appear to be either a cause or an effect of severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Constipation and Diarrhea</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Among all three samples fewer than one percent of the men complained about either constipation or diarrhea. Nervousness has often been said to wreck havoc upon the digestive track, and to cause diarrhea in the very shy. However, the loveshy men of both groups engaged in so much social avoidance behavior that it is not really possible to accurately test this viewpoint with the data at hand. Suffice it to say that neither constipation nor diarrhea appear to differentiate loveshy men from non-shy menâ€”at least not as far as the data collected for this book are concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Problems of the Nose</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the few medical symptom areas that did serve to sharply differentiate the loveshys from the non-shys had to do with problems of the nose. Indeed, if one were to predict among a large group of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>3 6 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">elementary school boys just exactly who is likely to go on to a life of chronic and painful loveshyness, there does not appear to be any better or more readily observable <i class="calibre4"> medical</i> predictor than that of difficulties involving the nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous questions pertinent to nasal difficulties were asked of all respondents. What follows is a summary of the rather thought-provoking results which the reader should find quite easy to review and to understand.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 6 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of these questions pertained to colds or to other infections of the upper respiratory track. I shall focus a bit later on the issue of headcolds. At the present juncture we need to focus on the fact that loveshy males,  <i class="calibre4"> from very early in childhood onward, </i> seem to be a great deal more likely than most people to suffer difficulty in breathing through the nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For centuries the great philosophers have made passing comments about the relationship of <i class="calibre4"> nasal breathing</i> to a sense of personal freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in eastern religion and in Spiritualism it has been taught for better than 4,000 years that a blocking of the <i class="calibre4"> left</i> nostril issues forth a blocking of the ability to love and to express feelings emotionally; whereas a blocking of the right nostril creates a blocking in the effective flow of the intellect and of the verbal expression of ideas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, even if a person wishes to discount the viewpoints of the ancients, there are certain empirically based facts which cannot be ignored. For example, virtually all severely loveshy men agree that they suffer from a lack of a sense of personal freedom. Indeed, most of the loveshy men interviewed for this book claimed that they had never felt anywhere nearly as free as most of their contemporaries seemed to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And these men made it clear that this lack of a sense of personal freedom was not due to any <i class="calibre4"> external</i> constraints of any kind. Pathologically loveshy men often use the word "inertia" to describe their inability to take the kind of positive, constructive action on their own behalf which they know they should take, and which they usually know (from an intellectual standpoint) how to effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The well-known British psychiatrist Robert Laing, has similarly noted how men who seem to be caught in chronic ruts (often in spite of strong intellectual assets), quite typically complain of an inability to breathe freely through the noseâ€”and how as a result of not being able to breathe freely they do not feel free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If we accept the view that the human body is a kind of energy force field that is dependent for healthy functioning on a steady flow of incoming energies from external sources, then it seems quite clear that a chronic blocking of the nasal passages may have a bearing on a blocking of energies that are crucial to (1) feeling free, and (2) to effective social interaction with other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recent research at the University of Bucharest in Romania, has documented the fact that man's body is suffused by an energy field that is often called an aura. Dr. Florin Dumitresko has taken color motion pictures of this aura using Kirlian photography apparatus. And he has found that when no acupuncture points show up in a person's Kirlian photographs, that person is healthy. However, when dots show up on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>3 6 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">a person's Kirlian photographs, those dots point directly to the section of the body with incipient or already present illness or pathology. In short, behind the Iron Curtain Kirlian photography is already being used quite successfully for diagnostic purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus far these studies have supported the beliefs of the ancients that important sources of energy, quite apart from air, are fed into the body with oxygen <i class="calibre4"> via the nose; </i> and that when breathing must take place through the mouth and not through the nose, the Kirlian aura (human energy field) loses its healthy luster and weakens. Of course, important energies also enter the body through the acupuncture points themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But nasal breathing now appears to be crucial for the receipt of energies which are necessary for healthy functioning. These energies are very important for enabling a person to feel free and in control of his life. If you block a person's nasal breathing, very quickly he will begin to feel bogged down in a kind of inexplicable, vague inertia.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications for Shyness Prevention</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Until quite recently most health professionals have rather curtly and summarily dismissed nasal breathing problems as being purely psychosomaticâ€”except, of course, instances that clearly involved headcolds. The very high degree of specialization within the medical profession is undoubtedly a major reason for this. Most physicians know little about the nose and quite often have as little awareness of debilitating <i class="calibre4">inborn</i> nasal conditions as the man on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today more and more physicians are becoming aware of the fact that a significant minority of people are born with a condition known as "deviated septum and polyps". Males are a good deal more vulnerable to this problem than females, and it is also more common among people of Irish and British ancestry than it is among other groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4"> septum</i> is the cartilage which separates the two nostrils. Very often, even when the exterior of the nose is quite normal, this cartilage renders one side of the nose much smaller than the other. Consequently, the mucous which collects within the nose is not afforded proper drain-age. In essence, the mucous is prevented from being blown out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasal polyps quite frequently accompany the deviated septum.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unlike the deviated septum, people are seldom born with nasal polyps already in place. Instead they are born with a vulnerability for such polyps to develop. People with allergies are believed to be highly susceptible to nasal polyps; and children with allergic problems will commonly begin developing polyps well before they complete their elementary school education.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 6 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the deviated septum and polyps coexist in a person's nose, nasal breathing ranges from very difficult to well nigh impossible. The polyps and deviated septum prevent the flow of mucous out of the body, and very often obviate the flow of air through the nose even when no mucous is present. Further, when the victim of this problem does catch a cold, he is likely to suffer from it a great deal longer and more severely than another person who catches the same headcold germ but does not have a deviated septum or nasal polyps. This is because the polyps provide germs with a much larger array of places to hide and to be protected than what would ordinarily be available in the normal upper respiratory track.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The symptoms described to me by most of the respondents with nasal breathing difficulties sounded very much like "deviated septum and polyps". Very few of the men studied had ever been to a nasal specialist. In every case those who had been to see a specialist indicated that "deviated septum and polyps" had indeed been what they were suffering from. Those who had visited nonspecialists tended to have been summarily dismissed as having a psychosomatic symptom; and if the doctor gave them anything at all for the problem it was merely a prescription for a nasal spray.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, my first recommendation to any loveshy person with chronic nasal breathing problems is to seek out a nasal specialist. These specialists are called rhinologists and are nowadays listed under that designation in the Yellow Pages of all major urban telephone directories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elementary school teachers can place themselves in the front line of attack relative to problems that can become chronic and intractable, and cause lives to become unhappy and nonproductive. The parents of all children with nasal breathing problems should be strongly urged by elementary educators to take their children to a rhinologist for a complete diagnosis. This is all the more important if teachers observe a child with chronic nasal breathing problems who is also chronically shy and who is an isolate or does not make friends as easily and readily as most children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If surgery is recommended by the physician, it should be performed. Nasal polyps can quite commonly be removed under a local anesthetic right in a doctor's office. However, when a deviated septum is present a general anesthetic must be used. And the child (or adult) will be required to remain in the hospital for just one overnight period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus the procedure is considered minor surgery; it can be quickly and easily performed. However, its impact on a child's life may be anything but minor. Such a surgical procedure might remove from a child one of the more important factors that contribute to the development of severe and intractable loveshyness and behavioral inertia.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"></a>3 7 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further issue that may be of especial relevance to the loveshyness problem is that nasal breathing difficulties may impede the free flow of necessary oxygen to the brain, especially during sleep. A key characteristic of loveshy men is that they suffer considerable difficulty in thinking quickly and clearly under stress. A person who usually breathes quite freely through the nose may be getting significantly greater amounts of oxygen and other life energies than the person who is usually bogged down by nasal stuffiness. The more oxygen a brain receives, the more efficiently it can operate and the faster it can think. For example, joggers and runners frequently report that their thought processes tend to be in peak form immediately after a work-out session. Such flooding of the brain with oxygen not only helps to cure depression, but it may also help the brain to function more efficiently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, the inability of many a loveshy man to "think on his feet"</p>
<p class="calibre1">when he is under stress and anxiety may be due <i class="calibre4"> at least in part</i> to the blocking off of the free flow of oxygen and other energies that pass through the nose. Mouth breathers may be taking in significantly fewer of these energies (and oxygen) than nose breathers. This is another good reason why a loveshy man should waste no time in getting his nose checked out by a reputable rhinologist, especially if he has long suffered from nasal breathing problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conversations with many of the loveshy men in their apartments convinced me that the deviated septum with polyps can aggravate self-consciousness. Many of these men use a veritable mountain of kleenex each day. In fact, many of the loveshys had used kleenex on the floor all over their living quarters. The necessity of using so very much kleenex is bound to render a person a bit apprehensive about interacting much with others. It is especially likely to render him nervous about inviting others to his living quarters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the presence of a deviated septum with polyps often causes a large piece of "snot" to pop out of a person's nose quite by surprise when he is not ready with a kleenex. For example, a person will blow his nose in a kleenex several times without much of anything coming out. Then two minutes later he might press one finger against a side of his nose to force some air through, and a large piece of solid mucous pops out. Several of my loveshy respondents commented about this matter, and indicated that they often worried about it accidentally happening publicly. Of course, such large pieces of mucous often spontaneously leave the nose by way of the alimentary canal (rear of the nose); and several loveshys claimed that on numerous occasions they almost choked when this spontaneously happened to them upon lying down in their beds.1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness 371</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hyperactive salivary glands constitute another condition which causes many loveshys to use an excessive amount of kleenex. This problem will be dealt with later in this chapter under "hypoglycemia".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Allergies</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 66 percent of the older loveshys and 43 percent of the younger loveshys had been diagnosed at some time in their lives as having one or more allergies. The same had been true for <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident non-shy men. Inasmuch as allergies are widely believed by rhinologists to contribute to the development of nasal polyps, the much more widespread prevalence of diagnosed allergies among the two loveshy samples than among the non-shy sample cannot be viewed as surprising.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, shyness with its psychoemotional consequences of being</p>
<p class="calibre1">"left out" socially may serve to somewhat lower a person's resistance to allergies. This is one reason why many people seem to undergo a spontaneous remission of all their allergies as they grow into adulthood and become socially self-confident. On the other hand, there are many people for whom allergies remain chronicâ€”especially those with lower levels of interpersonal competence. And people afflicted with such chronic allergies are often likely to develop the nasal polyps problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The polyps develop in the upper respiratory track as a way of preventing pollins from getting into the interior of the body. Thus the nasal polyps serve as a kind of "protective" shield or barrier. But in so doing, they block and often totally obviate a person's nasal breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the person comes to experience the dearth of personal freedom referred to earlier. Of course, respiration can always proceed through the mouth; but necessary energies may be useless to a person unless they enter the body through the nose. This may be one reason why people with headcolds often feel "drained of energy".2</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Dry Mouth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Not surprisingly, the problem of dry mouth was about four times more prevalent among the loveshys than among the non-shys. And whereas nervousness can cause dry mouth, it would appear that its most usual cause is simply that of not being able to breathe through the nose. In essence, air coming in and out of the body through the mouth will inevitably serve to dry out the mouth's tissues.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"></a>372 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshy men were very self-conscious about halitosis (bad breath); and this problem seemed to be similarly related to dry mouth as well as to hypoglycemiaâ€”a problem which will be dealt with later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Common Cold</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">People with chronic nasal breathing problems have long been known to suffer a good deal more than most people from the common cold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, it cannot be considered surprising that the two severely loveshy samples suffered substantially more from the common cold than the self-confident non-shy men did. Shyness and particularly the problem of being without a love-partner is widely believed by physicians in the United States to bring on the common cold. This is because the stress of being without love and companionship can lower the resistance of the various bodily defense systems. In their articles on the common cold many doctors cite the lyrics which Frank Loesser wrote for the GUYS</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND DOLLS song titled "Adelade's Lament" back in 1950: The average unmarried female, basically insecure,</p>

<p class="calibre1">From a lack of community property and a feeling she's getting too old,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a person can develop a death of a cold!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, an important question that needs to be raised is that of why loveshy people are so much more likely to choose headcold symptoms and nasal breathing symptoms rather than headaches, backaches, stomach aches, overweight problems, cramps, constipation, diarrhea, fevers, accident proneness, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> As yet no one has been able to come up with a satisfactory answer to this question. Moreover, it seems very likely on the basis of the facts already presented here that at least some of the headcolds from which loveshy people suffer are due in part to the presence of a deviated septum and/or nasal polyps. Colds which last for an inordinate amount of time are particularly likely to be sustained and aggravated by the deviated septum and polyps problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this point is well supported by the research data of the medical specialty of rhinology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following represents a summary of the questions asked pertinent to the common cold. The fact that the older loveshys suffer from considerably greater problems pertinent to the common cold than the younger loveshys do, suggests that there may be a direct relationship between severity of loveshyness on the one hand, and the common cold on the other.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Another interesting point suggested by the foregoing findings is that <i class="calibre4"> severity</i> of cold suffering appears to be a somewhat better barometer of loveshyness than <i class="calibre4"> frequency</i> of colds. In other words, even though the loveshy do tend to suffer from more frequent colds than the non-shy, it is the (1) severity of suffering, and (2) the length of time the average cold lasts, that makes the most difference.3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Reactive Hypoglycemia</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hypoglycemia</i> means <i class="calibre4"> low blood sugar. </i> It is caused by the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas sucreting more insulin after a meal or snack than the body requires. No reliable data are available as to the true prevalence of reactive hypoglycemia in the United States. However, most estimates vary from 25 percent to 45 percent of the population. In essence, probably somewhere around one-third of all Americans suffer from it to some extent; and about 10 percent of the population suffers from it quite severely. It is a problem which quite frequently remains undiagnosed; and it is one about which a considerable portion of physicians are biased and incapable of professional objectivity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reactive hypoglycemia <i class="calibre4"> may</i> (and I underscore the word <i class="calibre4"> "may")</i> be important in arriving at an accurate understanding of the genesis of severe loveshyness. This is because many of the symptoms about which loveshy people most often complain tend to be quite commonplace among reactive hypoglycemics. In short, loveshy people <i class="calibre4"> and</i> reactive hypoglycemics tend to share a number of common symptoms. To be sure, not all hypoglycemics are loveshy. However, there is evidence suggesting that most males with reactive hypoglycemia tend to be socially inhibited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First among the symptoms common to both loveshyness and hypoglycemia is chronic fatigue and low physical energy.  <i class="calibre4"> Inertia, </i> that feeling of somehow being powerless to remove the invisible chains that bind one to the ambiance of a boring life, represents a key manifestation of chronic fatigue. And a full 47 percent of the older loveshys complained of this, compared to only 11 percent of the self-confident non-shys. The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was 30 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reactive hypoglycemics are most likely to feel uncomfortably tired (1) upon waking up in the morning, and (2) shortly after eating a meal or a snack. People who feel especially tired even though they've slept well for a good seven or more hours are particularly likely to be afflicted with hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemic's blood sugar is especially likely</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"></a>376 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be quite low after the extended fast represented by a full night's sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the fatigue that ensues for the hypoglycemic shortly after eating is due to the fact that the ingested sugars and starches (which turn to sugar) quite rapidly cause a lowering of the blood sugar by causing the Isles of Langerhans to release too much insulin. It is for this reason that teachers, parents and therapists should pay particularly close attention to this finding:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "I often feel sleepy after eating breakfast and I return to bed when it is feasible for me to do so."  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the self-confident non-shys indicated that this statement was true for themselves. However, 21 percent of the younger loveshys and 25 percent of the older loveshys responded to the statement in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Breakfast here in the United States is the most hypoglycemic meal of the day inasmuch as it is made up almost exclusively of sugars and starches: cereals, pancakes, toast with jam, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In fact, pancakes are undoubtedly the worst of all foods for people with reactive hypoglycemia because of the syrupâ€”which is pure liquid glucose, and is hence very rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A related statement to which all of the respondents reacted was the following: "During my high school years I was usually so tired after my last class that I was anxious to get home so that I could take a nap."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And again,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the self-confident non-shys agreed, compared to 22 percent of the younger loveshys and 31 percent of the older loveshys. In short, almost one-third of the most pathologically loveshy men of this study suffered from a major symptom of reactive hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this does not prove that each of these men actually had hypoglycemia. I am not a physician and could not legally conduct a test of any respondent's blood sugar. However, recent medical studies on high school teenagers have shown that young people who experience extreme tiredness by the end of the school day (1) usually <i class="calibre4"> do</i> have reactive hypoglycemia, and (2) eat and drink significantly more than the usual amount of high sugar content foods, such as soda pop, candy, pasta, cakes and pastries, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And indeed this is what I also found with respect to questions pertaining to both past and present eating behavior. For example, I asked each respondent to estimate the number of cans of soda pop he drank <i class="calibre4">per week</i> when he was approximately fifteen year old. Of course, memory does fade with time. But there is little reason to believe that it would fade differently for the loveshys than for the non-shys. Thus it may be significant that the older loveshy men had recalled drinking an average of 5.41 cans of soda pop per week at the age of fifteen. The figure for the younger loveshys was 4.85 cans, and that for the self-confident non-shys was just 3.36 cans.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p408"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 7 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys had long maintained a strong penchant for sweet drinks involving milk and chocolate or malt. The older loveshy men recalled averaging 6.57 such drinks per week during their teen years, compared to only 4.43 such drinks for the younger loveshys and 2 27 for the self-confident non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding candy bars, the older loveshys estimated that they had eaten an average of 4.87 candy bars per person per week during their teenaged years. In contrast, the self-confident non-shys had eaten an average of only 2.21 candy bars per person per week. The younger loveshy men were in between with an average figure of 3.73 candy bars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And regarding current behavior, much of this same "sugar addict"</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior seems to be repeating itself. For example, most of the men in both loveshy groups presently use two teaspoonfuls of sugar for every cup of coffee or tea which they drink. On the other hand, the non-shy men usually use just one teaspoonful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chronic fatigue and lethargy feelings that are symptomatic of reactive hypoglycemia can and often do serve to strengthen and reinforce loveshyness. One way they can do this is through enabling the afflicted individual to feel perfectly justified in avoiding extracurricular and other social activities so that he can go home and rest. The fatigue that accompanies reactive hypoglycemia provides a constantly ready excuse for social avoidance. And as such it represents one of the many ways whereby normal social-emotional growth and development can be stunted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, as a <i class="calibre4"> very real</i> medical condition, reactive hypoglycemia and its numerous symptoms are anything but figments of a weak-willed person's imagination. The symptoms are quite real and in extreme cases can even be life-threatening. It is therefore highly desirable for parents, teachers, and young people to become aware of the symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia so that a proper diagnosis can be made when such symptoms appear. With the right diet young people with reactive hypoglycemia can regain huge amounts of energy which they never suspected they had latent within them. (This is especially true if a physician checks them over for the full array of food allergies. See chapter 16.) Inasmuch as severe shyness is usually indicative of a kind of behavioral inertia along with low energy, the correct medical treatment together with a non-hypoglycemic diet could scarcely help but alleviate at least a few of the most stubborn and intractable symptoms of severe shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, a chronic, low energy level is not always related in any way to hypoglycemia. Sometimes it is a function of biochemically based depression. Sometimes it is merely a psychosomatic byproduct of a boring lifestyle. This is why a correct medical diagnosis is of the utmost importance. However, my own research has led me to believe that reactive hypoglycemia is a fairly widespread concomitant of severe loveshyness. In fact, there are sound reasons for speculating that as many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"></a>3 7 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">as two-thirds of all young men who are too shy to date and to socialize with women (in spite of genuine heterosexuality) are victims of reactive hypoglycemia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the questions I asked of each man interviewed was: "Compared to people of your own age and sex, how much <i class="calibre4"> energy</i> do you see yourself as having?" It should be noted that this question is loaded with what social scientists call <i class="calibre4"> "social desirability valence". </i> How many young people in today's high energy society could easily admit to themselves and to others that they possess a dearth of energy? Probably not many!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, for this reason the obtained results for this question may very likely represent an <i class="calibre4"> underestimation</i> of the true state of affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this point in mind, 55 percent of the older loveshy men together with 44 percent of the younger loveshy men viewed themselves as having <i class="calibre4"> less energy</i> than most people. This was true for only 13 percent of the self-confident non-shys. In short, the loveshys were approximately four times more likely than the non-shys to perceive themselves as suffering from a dearth of energy compared to the majority of people in their respective environments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Frequent or chronic lethargy (low energy level) is, of course, the main symptom of reactive hypoglycemia. And it is well reflected in the often unpleasant task which each person has to face each and every dayâ€”namely, getting up out of bed in the morning. And in this regard I asked each man to react to the statement: "Even when I've slept for a good seven hours, I still seem to have much greater difficulty than most people in getting up out of bed in the morning." And 62 percent of the older loveshys along with 50 percent of the younger loveshys agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, only 17 percent of the non-shy men saw fit to agree with that statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each man to give me an estimate as to the number of minutes it <i class="calibre4"> usually</i> takes from the time he wakes up in the morning until the time he actually gets up out of bed. The averages for <i class="calibre4"> weekday mornings</i> were: 16.3 minutes for the older loveshys; 12.9 minutes for the younger loveshys; and 7.71 minutes for the non-shys. The averages for <i class="calibre4"> weekend</i> <i class="calibre4">mornings</i> were: 38.6 minutes for the older loveshys; 28.5 minutes for the younger loveshys; and 22.2 minutes for the self-confident non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting up out of bed in the morning had long been an exceptionally unpleasant chore for a good many of the loveshys. In fact, some of the loveshys even went so far as to speculate that below the college level their educational careers might have been at least somewhat more successful if early morning hours had not been required. And the data back them up on this point. The loveshy men were much more likely than the non-shys to have been <i class="calibre4"> better students</i> at the university level</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 7 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">than they had been at the high school level. And several of the loveshys speculated that a key reason was that at college they could either avoid early morning classes altogether, or if they were unfortunate enough to have an 8:00 AM class they could go back to bed after it was overâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">tact which had simply not proved feasible below the college level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, loveshy boys might well benefit from a different type of school hours: 11 AM to 5:30 PM was suggested by several of my loveshy respondents as being far more suitable for themselves than the current 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM. In essence, the number of school hours would remain the same; the virtue of the later schedule is that it would permit more children to arrive at school well rested and in a better position to learn.4</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Other Hypoglycemic Symptoms</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas frequent or chronic tiredness represents the dominant symptom of reactive hypoglycemia, there are some other symptoms I wish to mention, particularly since they too were found to be considerably more prevalent among the ranks of the loveshys than among the ranks of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, hypoglycemic young men often suffer from severe leg cramps, especially upon waking up in the morning. In fact, such severe cramps often quite rudely and painfully awaken hypoglycemics in the middle of the night and cause the victim to instantly rise and sit hard upon the calf of the leg. Among the respondents studied for this book, such severe leg cramps were three times more commonplace among the loveshys than they were among the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Acid stomach is another fairly frequent side effect of hypoglycemia, and 33 percent of the older loveshys (and 24 percent of the younger loveshys) suffered from this, compared to just 12 percent of the non-shy men. Ulcers, on the other hand, were not commonplace among any of the samples studied. None of the older loveshys had them, whereas only 6 percent of the self-confident non-shys and 4 percent of the younger loveshys indicated any problem with ulcers. (Fewer than 5 percent of all three samples indicated stomach aches to be a frequent problem.) <i class="calibre4">Halitosis</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most widespread concomitants of hypoglycemia is halitosis or "bad breath". Of course, this is a problem that a person can very easily have without being cognizant of the fact! Be that as it may, 44 percent of the older loveshys and 37 percent of the younger ones</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"></a>380 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed that they had this problem "quite a bit of the time", compared to only 3 percent of the non-shy men. Bad breath can create a good deal of self-consciousness and can significantly aggravate shyness feelings by encouraging more and more avoidance behaviors. And, by the way, this is also true with respect to an extreme fear of catching headcold germsâ€”a quite commonplace fear among the loveshys. Clearly, there is a vicious circle here; the more a person avoids social interaction, the more inhibited and fearful he becomes, and the less socially competent he is likely to become relative to his contemporaries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is important to note that halitosis or "bad breath" also relates quite closely to the problems of deviated septum and nasal polyps, which were discussed earlier. The necessity of breathing through the mouth almost all the time serves to dry out the mouth quite rapidly. And to the extent that a person's mouth is dry it is also far more likely than otherwise to exude a foul odor. In short, two medical problems which appear to be quite commonplace among loveshy men are also known to contribute to a high probability of bad breath: (1) reactive hypoglycemia, and (2) deviated septum with nasal polyps. Halitosis is a strong catalyst reinforcing loveshyness, social inertia, and social inactivity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Correct medical diagnosis and treatment (along with regular use of non-hypoglycemic breath mints) can effectively remove these medical conditions as a cause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem of finding proper breath mints is not an easy or simple one. Most men with reactive hypoglycemia have to use prescription products here because most over-the-counter products will cause (1) excessive feelings of fatigue, and/or (2) a foul after-taste, and/or (3) excessive salivation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hyperactive Salivary Glands</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Hyperactive salivary glands have also been found to relate to the broader medical condition of reactive hypoglycemia. This problem can also be exacerbated by certain food allergies. People who are allergic to milk very often secrete too much very thick and foul-tasting saliva. Of course, sometimes the problem is caused by enlarged salivary glands.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, hypoglycemia can and does cause people to produce too much salivaâ€”a problem which caused so many of the loveshys I interviewed to use an inordinate amount of kleenex. As an antidote, most loveshy men seem to drink unusually large amounts of water. On the job or at school they remain close to the water cooler because water is just about the only thing they have been able to find which keeps their mouths feeling moist and pleasant without producing any adverse side</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness 381</p>
<p class="calibre1">effects apart from a fairly frequent need to urinate. Again, most healthy people can simply poke a "life saver" or a piece of hard candy into their mouths as a means of feeling more comfortable. Most loveshy people cannot seem to be able to do this without feeling severe fatigue, an uncomfortable feeling in their stomach, or a very bitterly unpleasant after-taste. Unfortunately, sugar-free breath pills seem to cause the same unpleasant effects for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A good illustration of the problems which many loveshys have in dealing with hypersalivation can be seen in the reactions I obtained for the following statement: "I am often psychologically incapable of swallowing my own saliva". Only 5 percent of the self-confident non-shys agreed with this statement, compared to 26 percent of the older loveshys and 18 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem of hypersalivation seems to be, at least in part, sex-linked. For example, females (of all ages) are very rarely observed to expectorate in public. And whereas this may to some extent be due to the greater concern that many females feel about etiquette, it seems likely that basic biochemical differences between the two sexes may also have a good deal to do with the matter. The fact that females almost never have the amount of phlegm to expectorate in the morning upon arising which men have, may also reflect this possibility.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In regard to this matter, I asked each man to react to the statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I feel that I have to spit much more frequently than most people." And 65 percent of the older loveshys together with 53 percent of the younger ones said "yes". In contrast, only 38 percent of the non-shys indicated that they felt they had to "spit" more often than most people. By the way, in psychoanalysis frequent spitting has long been viewed as a reflection of <i class="calibre4"> anger. </i> And there is, of course, a possibility that the greater <i class="calibre4">anger</i> (at themselves and others) of the loveshys may be partially responsible for this symptomology. On the other hand, I think it is highly unlikely that such anger could be the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> cause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, in regard to the issue of milk allergies, I asked each man to react to the statement: "Milk seems to cause very heavy, bitter-tasting saliva to form in my mouth." And 33 percent of the older loveshys together with 27 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4"> agreed. </i> In contrast, only 13 percent of the non-shy men agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Hyperprespiration</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A further problem which many medical specialists believe to be a concomitant of reactive hypoglycemia is copious overprespiration. Most of the body's sweat glands are of the <i class="calibre4"> merocrine</i> type and thus do not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"></a>382 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce an odor. Only the <i class="calibre4"> apocrine</i> sweat glands produce a foul odor, and these are the ones that are located under each arm pit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the high prevalence of the other hypoglycemic symptoms among the loveshys who were studied for this book, it is not surprising that 73 percent of the older loveshys and 66 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with this statement: "My underarm prespiration seeems to be far heavier than most people's and is much more difficult to control."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> only 15 percent</i> of the self-confident non-shy men saw fit to agree with this statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like halitosis, the odors created by overactive apocrine sweat glands can easily serve to enhance self-consciousness and exacerbate loveshyness. Moreover, these problems are not particularly easy for loveshy people to discuss. Normally, the loveshy will avoid discussion of such problems, even when face to face with a physician or a psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And, of course, this self-disclosure reticence renders it all the more difficult for helping professionals to provide appropriate aid. One cannot remedy a problem unless it is placed squarely on the table for all concerned to see and to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Surgery is one available means for curing the hyperprespiration problemâ€”although this solution should not be accorded too much emphasis as it may not be warrented except in the most extreme cases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, some of the apocrine (under arm) sweat glands can be surgically removed. Many such operations have been performed; and it does seem to be a procedure which alleviates the "body odor" problem to some extent. Of course, hypoglycemic loveshys should attend <i class="calibre4"> first</i> to their reactive hypoglycemia problem. If a licensed physician provides a positive diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia, appropriately treating that problem will automatically reduce (and possibly even cure) all of the side symptoms which I have been discussing, such as hyperprespiration, halitosis, leg cramps, acid stomach, fatigue, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> If hyperprespiration <i class="calibre4">continues</i> to be a problem after the hypoglycemia has been treated and the diet has been reformed,  <i class="calibre4"> then and only then</i> the chronic body odor problem might be effectively alleviated through having some of the underarm sweat glands excised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exacerbating the problem of chronic body odor is the loveshy man's great allergic sensitivity to the various over-the-counter deodorants. Each man studied was asked to respond to this statement: "Conventional deodorants cause painful blisters to form under my arm pits."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And fully 31 percent of the older loveshys along with 25 percent of the younger ones responded in the affirmative, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (none) of the non-shy men. It is because of such allergic reactions that many dermatologists do recommend surgery for the excising of some of the underarm apocrine sweat glands. But in the meantime there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness 383</p>
<p class="calibre1">are prescription deodorants and special soaps which may serve to substantially alleviate the problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Depression</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A</i> final symptom which many physicians have found to be a typical concomitant of hypoglycemia is depression. In contrast to the other symptoms discussed in this section, this one is often psychological in natureâ€”although in extreme and chronic cases it may have a biochemical basis, as per the discussion in chapter two. Depression would seem to be quite logically related to chronic loveshyness, especially in view of the loveshy man's tendency to avoid social activity vis-a-vis the other sex which he so strongly craves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In any case, 72 percent of the older loveshys and 51 percent of the younger ones checked "frequent feelings of depression" on the medical symptom checklist. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the 200 self-confident non-shy men saw fit to check "frequent feelings of depression".</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the effective treatment of reactive hypoglycemia might not relieve all or even most of the depression from which loveshy men are prone to suffer. On the other hand, "nipping hypoglycemia in the bud" among young children could well prevent such symptoms as chronic depression from developing in the first place. Depressed feelings cannot be so easily remedied among older people. Loveshy middle-aged and young adult males have grown so used to socially avoidant behavior and have developed so many bad habits that some form of behavior therapy (such as practice-dating) is likely to be necessary for successfully helping them. However, purely medical (as opposed to psychological) treatment can serve as a very helpful and perhaps even absolutely necessary catalyst for facilitating the effective functioning of the more psychoemotionally-based therapies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, we must keep a constantly watchful eye for effective ways of preventing severe loveshyness from developing in the first place. The need for accurate medical diagnosis and treatment of the various symptoms discussed in this chapter cannot be overemphasized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remove the problem while the child is young and the problem is likely to be gone forever, provided that parents and teachers become dedicated to <i class="calibre4"> lovingly</i> ensuring that the child sticks to a good diet. They must make sure that hypoglycemic children understand both emotionally and intellectually the reasons behind that good diet, so that each child has the benefit of a well-developed set of <i class="calibre4"> internal</i> controls and does not need to depend upon coercive external controls. Indeed, the parents must also maintain a warm, nurturing environment so that the child is not afraid to go out, make friends of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> sexes, and take social risks.5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"></a>3 8 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Throat Clearing and Coughing</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the characteristics that I have long noticed among socially inactive men is that they tend to clear their throats and/or cough significantly more often than anybody else. You can enter any university library during any month or season of the year, and find that the most persistent bookworms quite commonly approach the point of creating a public nuisance with their frequent and often loud coughing and/or throat clearing. (Maybe this is a latent way of crying out for loving heterosexual attention!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sheer fact of sustaining a dedicated, serious attitude towards academic study by itself is not sufficient to create this coughing/throat clearing syndrome. There are many young men who are quite serious about their academic work and who very seldom find it necessary to clear their throats or cough. Of course, such young men are usually the ones who are emotionally capable of maintaining a reasonably well balanced life. They may study for five or six hours per day; but they <i class="calibre4"> also</i> have their lover around them five or six hours per day as well. Moreover, quite often their lover will be found studying in the library at the same table with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, heterosexually active young men very seldom cough, and this seems to be true irrespective of how much time they devote to serious study. Years ago it had been believed that the dedicated student had to lead somewhat of a monastic existence. Today we know that this simply is not so, and that an active premarital sex life (provided that it is monogamous and contraceptively protected) is more likely than not to facilitate the successful attainment of both academic and vocational goals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, coughing and frequent throat clearing in many cases may be closely related to the type of nasal problems discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But as these behaviors are often engaged in quite frequently and loudly in public places (such as university libraries), they may represent an exasperated cry for helpâ€”unconsciously made. These are very shy men we are talking about hereâ€”the very last type of persons we would expect to be making loud, ugly noises in public places. And yet they do it all the time, possibly with the unconscious fantasy in mind that someone (perhaps an attractive, youthful, maternal figure) will come to their res-cue and tend to their most deeply felt but long ignored social-emotional needs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heterosexually inactive young women seldom have such strong needs, and so they seldom cough the way loveshy men do. This is because they are usually able to find the emotional intimacy that they need through their same-sexed female friends. In American society</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 8 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">heterosexual men are very seldom if ever able to satisfy their most deeply felt emotional needs through same-sexed male friends. Only a female will do for this purpose. And this is a key reason why sociologists and psychologists have long recognized the fact that men of all ages need women a great deal more than women need men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of the men studied were asked to respond to the statement: "I have a tendency to want to clear my throat a good deal more often than most people." And not surprisingly, 60 percent of the older loveshy men and 47 percent of the younger loveshys said <i class="calibre4"> "yes", </i> compared to only 19 percent of the self-confident non-shy men. Moreover, in response to the statement: "It seems that I feel the urge to cough a good deal more often than most people", only 6 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed, compared to 40 percent of the older loveshys and 32</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Gas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men do not appear to be anymore prone to gas problems than the non-shy. In fact, not one member of either the loveshy or the non-shy samples indicated either "chronic gas" or "frequent need to fart" as representing any kind of a noteworthy problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Eyeglasses</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that America has long passed the time when very many boys are bullied or hazed because they wear eyeglasses. In this regard I believe that we have "grown up" and matured at least a little bit as a culture. My father who grew up attending Catholic schools in Jersey City, New Jersey, during the second and third decades of this century, has often commented upon how eyeglass wearers had been routeinly singled out for both verbal hazing and physical bullying. In working class neighborhoods some of this still goes on. But in middle-class school districts it has become relatively uncommon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Be that as it may, the wearing of eyeglasses continues to remain a component of the loveshy stereotype. Many people continue to associate the image of the eyeglasses-wearing schoolboy with the notion of social ineptitude, withdrawal, and excessive studiousness. Of course, many people look good in glasses. Nevertheless it may indeed be that the wearing of eyeglasses gives a young boy a head start towards the quagmire of intractable, chronic loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a>3 8 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time the data for this research were obtained only 27 percent of the non-shy men regularly wore corrective lenses, compared to 59</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys and 78 percent of the older loveshys Also of interest is the fact that better than one-third of the non-shys who wore glasses wore contact lenses. In contrast, not one loveshy man in either group wore contact lenses. Of course, this fact may reflect the unusually low sensitivity threshold of loveshy men. It requires some degree of eyeball insensitivity for a person to be able to tolerate contact lenses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, not every person wearing eyeglasses had commenced wearing them during childhood. In fact, it is widely believed today that the many tensions and stresses that are associated with prolonged and intense study <i class="calibre4"> create</i> myopia and sometimes astigmatism as well. Since loveshy men often endeavor to become highly competent at an academic subject in an effort to compensate for their social-emotional immaturity (lack of dates with women, unpopularity, etc.), their need to remain highly successful at college often creates considerably greater stress for them than it does for well-balanced, psychologically well-adjusted young men. Loveshy men have considerably more to lose if they do not perform well at school. The self-confident have their friends; loveshys are frequently friendless.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard I asked each respondent who wore corrective lenses whether he began wearing them (for the first time in his life) <i class="calibre4"> before or</i> <i class="calibre4">after</i> his 16th birthday. My hypothesis was that the loveshy would be much more likely than the non-shy to have commenced wearing eyeglasses <i class="calibre4"> after</i> the 16th birthday because they had had a much stronger need that the non-shy to pursue scholarly goals with a dedicated seriousness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hypothesis was borne out. Among the non-shy men who wore corrective lenses, only 9 percent had commenced wearing them <i class="calibre4"> after</i> their 16th birthday. In stark contrast, 35 percent of the younger loveshys who wore glasses and 41 percent of the older loveshys who wore glasses had commenced wearing them <i class="calibre4"> subsequent to</i> their 16th birthdays.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, the loveshy eyeglass-wearers were about four times as likely as the non-shy wearers to have begun wearing the corrective lenses <i class="calibre4"> after</i> the 16th birthday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, loveshy men often endeavor to develop intellectually as a means of compensating for serious shortcomings in their social-emotional lives. In so doing they often strain themselves quite formidably. And a byproduct of this emotional strain is even greater loveshyness, social inadequacy, myopia or astigmatism, and (often) a less attractive facial appearance. This is especially so given the widespread tendency among the loveshy to wear eyeglasses with rather dark and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness 387</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy plastic frames. Non-shy men very seldom wear such heavy frames.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the loveshy obviously need guidance in selecting eyeglass frames which serve to maximally upgrade facial appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Shortness of Stature</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I checked the height of each of the 500 men interviewed for this book. And there were no significant differences at all between the loveshys and the non-shys in this regard. Simply put, loveshy men do not appear to be anymore likely than non-shy men to be excessively or noticeably short.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, inequalities in this regard during early adolescence or childhood can leave emotional scars. But even here, the loveshy men were no more likely than the non-shys to have been unusually short during childhood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man whether he had reached adolescence (1) earlier, (2) later, or (3) at approximately the same time as other boys in his class at school. And even here there were few differences among the three samples. For example, 11 percent of the non-shys claimed that they had arrived at adolescence later in life than their male classmates. This had similarly been true for 14 percent of the older loveshys and for 17 percent of the younger ones. On the other hand, 31 percent of the non-shys claimed that they had become pubescent earlier than most other male children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was 12 percent, and for the older loveshys it was 13 percent. Hence, a clear majority of all three samples (58 percent of the non-shys, 71 percent of the younger loveshys and 73 percent of the older loveshys) felt that they had arrived at adolescence "at approximately the same time as most others of their sex".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, as I made clear in the chapter titled "Beauty and the LoveShy", the loveshy men had been far less likely than the non-shys to have been in any way satisfied or happy with their level of attractiveness during their teenaged years. Suffice it to say, though, that the <i class="calibre4">source</i> of the loveshys' dissatisfaction seldom had anything to do with being excessively short of stature.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Acne</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time the data for this research were obtained, none of the 500 men appeared to have any noteworthy skin problems. However, it is well-known that a history of teenage acne often leaves mild to serious</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"></a>3 8 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotional scars. And it is for this reason that I deemed it appropriate to ask each man a question about acne problems that might have been suffered during adolescence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not surprisingly, 63 percent of the older loveshys and 53 percent of the younger loveshys had had "moderate to severe" cases of teenage acne. In contrast, this had been true for only 26 percent of the self-confident non-shy men. Inasmuch as loveshy people are more sensitive and more easily hurt than the non-shy, selective memory may have been operating here. Thus, in view of the positive mental attitude that prevailed among them, the non-shys may have been more likely than the loveshys to have forgotten their former problems with acneâ€”and with a good many other things as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Irrespective of whether or not this had indeed been the case, it seems apparent that acne might well have contributed at least slightly to the social withdrawal habits and the self-consciousness tendencies of the loveshys. Acne is a quite noxious condition for teenagers. And in this regard it is heartening to note that between 1979 and 1983 enormous advances were made in the effective treatment of even the very worst cases of acne. Any teenager with such skin problems must be accorded ready access to the services of a competent dermatologist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During adolescence as throughout life males do differ among each other in terms of the relative amount of the hormone androgen in their blood streams. Androgen is the hormone that is responsible for acne.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The more excessive the amount of androgen in the bloodstream, the more severe the acne problem is likely to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From before they are born until late childhood, loveshy boys appear to suffer from a dearth of testosterones in their bloodstreams. On the other hand, they do not appear to suffer from any shortfall of most blood androgensâ€”the <i class="calibre4"> other</i> male hormone. In fact, throughout their teenage years most loveshys may well suffer from an <i class="calibre4"> excess</i> of certain blood androgens. Of course, it may be that the loveshys' body physiology is less equipped than that of the non-shy to handle the on-rush of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> androgens and testosterones that occurs with the onset of adolescence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the physiology of non-shy males during childhood may better prepare their bodies for smoothly and harmoniously absorbing the onrush of male hormones that occurs with the inception of pubescence. An inability in a person's body to smoothly handle such an onrush may help to cause such symptoms as severe acne.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that androgens are closely associated with acne problems ties in with one of Hans Eysenck's (University of London) most fascinating findings. Eysenck found that very shy people tend to have significantly stronger sex drives than non-shy people. He found that the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p420"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness  3 8 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">stronger and more persistent a man's anxiety feelings tended to be, the stronger would be his sex drive and the more frequently he would feel the need to masturbate. As I have already documented, loveshy men tend to masturbate far more frequently than do the non-shy. In fact, my own work showed that when one adds up the total number of ejaculations men experienced per month from all sources (e.g., masturbation, sexual intercourse, heavy petting, etc.), age for age the loveshy experience quite a few more orgasms than do self-confident, socially active men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is an important point because it documents a side of the loveshy man about which very few people are aware. The more deprived a man feels of the things he most desperately wants, the more severely preoccupied he is likely to become with respect to the source and substance of his felt deprivation. Hence, the typical loveshy man devotes much more time than the non-shy man to masturbating and to daydreaming about copulating with a beautiful girl of his choice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So a very cruel paradox here is that severe teenage acne serves to (1) exacerbate teenage unpopularity, particularly vis-a-vis the opposite sex, and to (2) increase self-consciousness and the self-defeating habit of social avoidance. But that very teenage acne is caused by the very same thing (i.e., excessive blood androgen) that <i class="calibre4"> also</i> causes an unusually heightened sexual interestâ€”an interest which is effectively blocked from fulfillment by the acne and related shyness and social self-consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, an amusing side point is that just as high blood androgen tends to be related to "hominess" in boys, it is <i class="calibre4"> also</i> related to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"horniness" in girls. More succinctly, the "horniest" high school girls can easily be spotted because they are the ones with the most conspicuous cases of acne! Of course, females have relatively less blood androgen than males do. And this is why the most severe cases of teenage acne are always suffered by males and not by females.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final point, the fact that the loveshys had consumed significantly more sugary items during their teenage years than the non-shys had may also have served to exacerbate their skin problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Insomnia</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys were somewhat more vulnerable to insomnia than the non-shys.  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the non-shy men indicated that they "often had difficulty falling asleep." On the other hand, 19 percent of the older loveshys and 16 percent of the younger loveshys "often" experienced difficulty in falling asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"></a>390 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Stuttering</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 5 percent of the older loveshys and 4 percent of the younger ones appeared to have any problems with stuttering at the time the interviews were conducted. However, only 44 percent of the older loveshys and 47 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that stuttering had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> been a problem for them. In contrast, 97 percent of the self-confident non-shys indicated that stuttering had never been a problem for them. In addition, none of the non-shys seemed to have any speech problems at the time the interviews were conducted.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Buck Teeth</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 26 percent of the older loveshys and 19 percent of the younger ones indicated that they had had problems with buck teeth. In contrast, only 6 percent of the non-shy men mentioned this as a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Hypochondria</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men appeared to be considerably more vulnerable than the non-shys to a fear of germs. This was no doubt related to the fact that when they do catch headcold germs they do seem to suffer a good deal longer and more severely than most people. In any case, 16</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 10 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they do not like to handle door knobs. This was true for <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another question I asked for reactions to this statement: "After touching the floor (like after completing push-ups) I always want to go to a sink and wash my hands." Fully 46 percent of the older loveshy men together with 31 percent of the younger loveshy men agreed.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shy men saw fit to endorse the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another question I asked for reactions to the following: "I would not eat a banana until after I first cut out any and all black or gray spots."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 65 percent of the older loveshys together with 52 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. Among the non-shy men the level of agreement was 33 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And 31 percent of the older loveshys along with 25 percent of the younger loveshys checked that they were sometimes fascinated by their bowel movements. This was true for just 4 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"></a>Medical Symptoms and LoveShyness 391</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, 68 percent of the older loveshys and 52 percent of the younger ones indicated that they always wash their hands immediately after taking the garbage out. This was true for only 35 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Psychotherapy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, I asked each man whether or not he had ever in his life sought help from a psychiatrist or clinical psychologistâ€”for any reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And not surprisingly, fully 100 percent of the older loveshys responded in the affirmative, along with 37 percent of the younger loveshys, and only 3 percent of the self-confident non-shy men. However, the experiences that the loveshys had had vis-a-vis psychotherapists had been far from satisfactory. In fact,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the loveshys interviewed for this book who had had psychotherapy at some point in their lives had major complaints to voice about their experiences.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of them had found therapy to be at all helpful from the standpoint of reducing their shyness and severe inhibition vis-a-vis women. Yet in spite of their stinging and often angrily voiced complaints, 24 percent of the older loveshys and 27 percent of the younger loveshys were actually seeing a therapist at the time they were interviewed for this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Chapter Postscript</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Los Angeles area physician Dr. Steven Rosenblatt is now quite successfully using a form of needleless acupuncture to totally cure prepubescent children of allergy problems. Through realigning the electromagnetic energy force field of certain portions of the surface skin where it is found to be out of proper alignment (i.e., a malaligned "aura"), allergies can be entirely done away with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As per my comments in the first four chapters of this book, an aura with various electromagnetic deficiencies has been found to be related to and to cause all manner of physical and psychoemotional problems. Per chance, intractable forms of shyness may be among these problems. This chapter has, of course, demonstrated a clear relationship between difficult allergy problems and shyness. It is obvious that much serious research is sorely needed on acupuncture and on the relationship between the body's aura and the full variety of physical and psychoemotional problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"></a>3 9 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Frequent nose picking as well as frequent scratching of the interior of the nose, appeared to be quite conspicuous problems of both groups of loveshys. The problem of severe nasal itches may be related to allergies. On the other hand, the more problematical symptom of a frequent need to pick one's nose is doubtless caused to a major extent by nasal polyps and deviated septum. In short, any obstruction which renders it difficult to pass mucous will have the effect of frequently creating a supply of dried-up phlegm in the nose. And, of course, this is what causes a person to feel a need to pick his nose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, nose picking behavior entails a very negative <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> here in American society. Hence, the frequent need to pick one's nose is bound to have an exacerbating impact upon feelings of self-consciousness and of severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. But there is another way in which allergies can exacerbate other health problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with allergies often suffer from attacks of <i class="calibre4"> itchy nose. </i> And as will shortly become apparent, the loveshys were found to be extremely susceptible to this problem. Scratching an itchy nose with one's fingers represents a major way by which infectious headcold germs are "caught".</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. In recent years the University of London has produced some fascinating research findings on the relationship between the sun's light rays and the seasonality of headcold suffering. Headcolds are caused by many variables which synergistically interact with one another. The variable of the sun's light rays has been largely ignored up to now in spite of the demonstrable seasonality of headcold suffering. It is clear that much more research needs to be done in this area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. In his recent work entitled STRESS FREE LIVING, Dr. Clay Sherman comments on an experiment that had been conducted in an elite boarding school for high school students. There were two groups in this experiment: (1) a group that was given a heavy daily dosage of malted milks, pastries, soda pop, candies, and other high sugar foods; and (2) a group that was kept low on such foods. At the end of the academic year during which the study was done, the first (high sugar) group was found to be significantly lower than the second group on such factors as: proportion of students holding high student offices in government, demonstrated interpersonal skills, demonstrated ability to get along well with and enjoy the company of other students, grade-point average, ability to concentrate well, quality of relations with adult authority figures, and athletic ability. At the beginning of the experiment both groups were equal in terms of the type of students that composed them. Thus, we have one more strong piece of evidence here that high sugar diets may represent a major variable (interacting in synergy with the other variables delineated in this book) giving rise to intractable loveshyness. Aggravating the situation is the fact that many depressed young people will eat sugary items in order to assuage feelings of depression and/or worthlessness and shyness. In this way such young people become progressively worse rather than better. The sugary remedy <i class="calibre4"> worsens</i> the disease.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Of course, children and teenagers often eat a lot of sugary foods as a <i class="calibre4"> substitute</i> for the <i class="calibre4"> love, </i> caring and concern that they are not getting from parents, peers, and opposite-sexed age-mates. Thus, it is quite possible that loveshy males own a much stronger need for such things as sugary pastry, sweet cereals, candy bars, malted milks, soda pop, etc., than do those young people who feel well loved, liked, etc., and who are excited about all the interesting and enjoyable <i class="calibre4"> social</i> activities which they have to pursue each day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this in mind, it should be patently obvious than it may not normally be very easy to "unhook" sugar addicts from their sugary food needs. Quite clearly, parents will <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be able to successfully rely upon coercive tactics in their efforts to motivate their loveshy sons to change their snack food diets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another point of interest is that shy people tend to use an above average quantity of <i class="calibre4"> salt</i> on certain of their foods. An addiction to salt is often a reflection of overworked, overstressed adrenal glands. As anxiety-prone people tend to be highly overstressed, their adrenal glands might well be overworked. And this would give rise to a craving for salt.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"></a>Chapter 16</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness and the Innate</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Sensitivities Issue</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshys seem to be far more "sensitive" than most people. So what else is new?! It almost goes without saying that shy people are</p>
<p class="calibre1">"sensitive". They are more sensitive than most people to rejection. Compared to most people, their feelings are more easily hurt. Real or imagined insults throw them off balance to a far greater extent than what is typical for most people. But what is not well-known is the fact that loveshys also suffer from a large host of sensitivities that are not ostensibly related to "people phobia" or to interpersonal interaction considerations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is about these <i class="calibre4"> "other" </i> sensitivities that this chapter will be concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that the study of sensitivities may offer us some important clues as to the causes of severe loveshyness. The research data obtained for this book dealt with only some of the potentially important sensitivity-related questions and issues. For example, are loveshy men more likely than most people to have <i class="calibre4"> food allergies? </i> And if so, to which foods and/</p>
<p class="calibre1">or chemical additives are they allergic? As per the data reviewed in chapter fifteen, we know that loveshy men had always been (throughout their lives) more vulnerable than most people to a host of allergies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inasmuch as they are more sensitive than most people to a wide variety of pollins, dust, animal dander, etc., it is not at all improbable that many loveshys <i class="calibre4"> may</i> have a variety of food allergies which may be exacerbating their problems and rendering their situation all the more chronic. It is certainly to be hoped that medical researchers will in the very near future check out a sample of loveshys for the full range of food allergies. In order to successfully help the loveshy, this sort of information and knowledge must be deemed quite indispensable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The issues of native temperament which were dealt with quite thoroughly in part one of this book, suggest a strong biological base for loveshynessâ€”a base which causes social learning to progress propitiously for some and more or less problematically for others. The issue 393</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"></a>394 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">of sensitivities suggests another biological base for understanding loveshyness. This is so because not all sensitivities could have been learned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, this is why the study of sensitivities is so thought-provoking and challengingâ€”challenging particularly of preconceived biases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, there are no easy or "pat" answers to the problem of accurately understanding the etiology of severe loveshyness. As for myself, I do not pretend to a full understanding of all the data to be reviewed in this chapter. This is why I want to present my findings in some detailâ€”so that interested people from all walks of life can begin asking all of the right questions pertinent to the etiology of severe and chronic loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bodily Itches</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bodily itches surely represent one of the most interesting of sensitivities. It is readily apparent that some people have a well above average number of itches. Indeed, some people appear to be almost always scratching themselves somewhere, whereas others almost never seem to feel the need to scratch. Could such differences between people be attributable to inborn biological factors? Unfortunately medical science has yet to furnish us with an answer to this question Suffice it to say that loveshyness appears to be fairly closely related to frequency of bodily itches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked each respondent: "Compared to most people, to what extent are you bothered by itches in many different parts of your body?" And 30 percent of the older loveshys along with 23 percent of the younger loveshys said <i class="calibre4"> "very frequently" </i>, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the self-confident non-shy men. In contrast, 41 percent of the non-shys said that they were <i class="calibre4"> never</i> bothered by bodily itches. Only 19 percent of the younger loveshys and 11 percent of the older ones similarly indicated that they were <i class="calibre4"> never</i> bothered by bodily itches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, it should be noted how a greater proportion of the older loveshys than of the younger ones had been frequently bothered by itches. Inasmuch as it is a fair assumption that as a group the older loveshys were more severely shy vis-a-vis women than the younger ones, the message appears clear: the more severe the loveshyness, the greater the amount of bodily sensitivities. The older loveshys had made it through to ages 35 to 50 in the "single, never married" category,  <i class="calibre4"> not</i> out of personal choice but because of shyness. Therefore, if sensitivities are related to loveshyness, we would logically expect such sensitivities to be more conspicuously manifest among the ranks of the older loveshys than among the ranks of the younger ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 395</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each respondent: "Compared to most people, how often do you find it necessary to scratch yourself in various parts of your body?" Here 30 percent of the non-shy men indicated <i class="calibre4"> "never"', </i> compared to just 13 percent of the younger loveshys and 7 percent of the older loveshys. At the opposite extreme, 34 percent of the older loveshys indicated that they had to scratch themselves <i class="calibre4"> "very often", </i> compared to 25 percent of the younger loveshys and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys. In fact, even more dramatic were the responses to this statement: "Lots of times I have so many itches all over my body that I scarcely know where to scratch first." Here 36 percent of the older loveshys and 27 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. But not one single non-shy man saw fit to agree with the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Climate</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his extensive work at New York University, Dr. Alexander Thomas has been able to document the fact that people are born with different degrees of sensitivity to heat, to cold, to pain, to light, and to several other forms of bodily discomfort. Expressed scientifically, people are born with different discomfort thresholds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these thresholds are sex-linked. For example, women have a lower threshold for cold than men do, whereas men have a lower threshold than women for heat and humidity. In studying young babies, Dr. Thomas found that as he decreased the heat in a room the girl babies began crying sooner than the boy babies. On the other hand, as he raised the heat of the room, the boy babies commenced protesting earlier than did the girl babies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Thomas and other scientists have found that these differences among people and between sexes tend to remain surprisingly stable throughout life. For example, men will typically derive less enjoyment than their wives out of vacationing in such hot, humid resort areas as Miami Beach, Bermuda, Honolulu, the Bahamas, Tahiti, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> On the other hand, wives will usually display impatience sooner than husbands with such cooler vacation spots as Ireland, Scotland, Norway, the Alps, the Canadian Rockies, the Oregon and Alaska coastlines, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But what is even more interesting is the fact that the differences which have been found between the two sexes are considerably less than the differences among members of either of the two sexes. For example, some women can tolerate cold far better than the vast majority of men, whereas many men can tolerate heat and humidity far better than the vast majority of women. It is useful to know that differences in the ability to tolerate heat and cold are at least in part sex-related.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"></a>396 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, differences in tolerance levels <i class="calibre4"> among people in general</i> are far greater than the average differences between the two gender groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men studied for this book gave evidence of being a good deal less tolerant of <i class="calibre4"> both hot and cold</i> weather than the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But as expected (given their previously documented tendency towards hyperprespiration), the loveshys also gave evidence of being bothered to a considerably greater extent by heat and humidity than by cold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Curiously, this turned out to be one of the few ways the loveshy men seemed more similar to "typical" members of their own gender, than to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"typical" members of the female gender.) Each respondent was asked to react to this statement: "It would be wonderful if I could live in a breezy climate where it never gets colder than 40 degrees Farenheit, or hotter than 60 degrees Farenheit." And according to the results, only 14 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed, compared to 58 percent of the older loveshy men and 42</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshy men. Many of the non-shy men specifically added that they took great pleasure in the changing of the seasons. And many of the men whom I interviewed in California claimed that this was something they especially strongly missed about the east and midwest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys, on the other hand, tended to take little pleasure in the changing of the seasons. They tended to prefer weather that was <i class="calibre4">constantly comfortable. </i> For most of the loveshys, October seemed to be the favorite month of the year. By and large, the loveshys tended to prefer constant spring and fall, with no summer and no winter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For some of the loveshys, even October entailed a noticeable deficit: they did not like the diminishing length of the days. Some of the loveshys interviewed in normally comfortable, coastal California complained that they wished there could be a place in the United States where the day length would be constantly the same. These men wanted it to become dark at 8:30 or 9PM throughout the year. A few men interviewed in California felt that their state should be on <i class="calibre4"> Mountain Time,</i> and not Pacific Time. Similarly, several of those interviewed in New York felt that New York and New England ought to be in the Atlantic Time Zone along with Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some writers have suggested that one of the reasons for the surfeit of homosexuals in San Francisco, Santa Monica, and other coastal areas of California, is that there is only about a 10 degree Farenheit difference between average January temperatures, and average July temperatures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, a cosmopolitan, tolerant, urban atmosphere doubtless has even more to do with the plentitude of homosexuals in such places. But</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"></a>Love-Shyncss and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 397</p>
<p class="calibre1">the possibility that a moderate and relatively unchanging climate (without too much sunshine) may also have something to do with it should not be discounted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, there are many significant differences between homosexuals and heterosexual loveshys. But as I have documented, there are also some very interesting similarities. And one of these similarities is the penchant so commonplace among both homosexuals and heterosexual loveshys for a constantly comfortable, moderate, unchanging weather picture.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bright Sunlight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the various sensitivities, few may be of greater significance than sensitivity to bright sunshine in accounting for the tendency among some children to withdraw from certain types of outdoor activity. And, of course, in American society this type of sensitivity would logically be expected to eventuate in more social harm to a boy child than to a girl child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the 500 respondents was asked to react to the following statement: "When I was a child I could not enjoy playing in bright sunlight; I could enjoy myself much easier in the shade or in cloudy weather." The obtained results indicated a level of agreement almost three times as great among the loveshys as among the non-shys. More specifically, only 21 percent of the non-shy men agreed with the statement. In stark contrast, fully 51 percent of the younger loveshys and 60 percent of the older loveshys agreed with the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, peer group interaction must be made pleasurable and rewarding if a child is to develop any motivation at all for pursuing such activity. If a child perceives outdoor play as unrewarding and possibly even painful, he will endeavor to avoid such activities to an ever increasing extent. In American society girls are perfectly free to avoid playing in bright sunlight <i class="calibre4"> without</i> incurring the hostile wrath of their peers. In fact, there is little reason to expect that the peer group life of a girl would be adversely affected at all by her unwillingness to take part in play activity within the context of bright sunshine. She will always be able to find plenty of friendly and sympathetic peers who, like herself, prefer to play indoors or outside the context of bright sunshine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">American methods of socializing boys tend to be quite rigid and cruel in this regard. Boys are not only strongly discouraged from playing within the framework of a coeducational peer group, but they are also quite often the victims of a dearth of play options. Their peers, and often</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"></a>3 9 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">their parents and teachers as well, commonly expect them to play at baseball and football. And no alternative sports, such as ping pong, bowling, indoor volleyball, etc., are made available as an option.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Wool</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the more widespread sensitivities is that of wool. Many people cannot wear it or use it because it feels like painful pin or needle pricks when it touches the skin. Very sensitive people cannot even wear a woolen sports jacket because the noxious effect of the wool penetrates right through the shirt that they are wearing, and sometimes through the undershirt (if they are wearing one) as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 7 percent of the self-confident non-shy men indicated that they could not wear wool. In contrast, 40 percent of the younger loveshys and 54 percent of the older loveshy men indicated that they could not wear woolen items because of the often severe feelings of discomfort (especially itchiness) that such clothing items create.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, a key question to be raised is that of why loveshy men are far more likely than non-shy men to find wool uncomfortable, and why they are more likely than the non-shy <i class="calibre4"> to</i> find weather warmer than 60F and cooler than 40F uncomfortable and disconcerting. Are all such differences <i class="calibre4"> really learned</i> in every case? Or do such differences between the loveshy and the non-shy reflect some basic, genetically rooted, biologically based (inborn) differences? All differences which undermine flexibility and adaptability are bound to render life more problematical and less enjoyable for the loveshy than for the non-shy. By itself, sensitivity to wool is a <i class="calibre4"> very</i> minor thing. But it <i class="calibre4"> may</i> (and I underscore the word <i class="calibre4"> "may")</i> relate to some broader based, genetic characteristics that differentiate loveshys from non-shys right from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Physical Pain</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is another area wherein sensitive males are at a far greater disadvantage than sensitive females. Several questions were asked of each of the 500 men studied. The first of these concerned the following scenario: "Picture yourself on a camping trip with a good many people of all ages. The area in which you are camping has some mosquitos and gnats. Compared to the other members of your party, to what extent do you think you would be bothered by the mosquitos and gnats?"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 399</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Nobody</i> among the 200 self-confident non-shys thought that they would probably be bothered <i class="calibre4"> more than</i> most of the other people. In contrast, fully 66 percent of the older loveshys and 45 percent of the younger loveshys thought that they would be bothered by the mosquitos and gnats to a greater extent than the other people. Several of the loveshys told me that they had an unusually strong sensitivity to mosquitos, and that whenever there are any mosquitos they "always"</p>
<p class="calibre1">come after them first. Some of the loveshys attributed this to the fact that their blood is somehow "sweeter" and "different" from the blood of most people. Others thought that their problems with mosquitos might be due to their very light skin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a further question I simply asked each man whether he considered himself to be more or less sensitive than the majority of people to physical pain. Only 7 percent of the non-shy men considered themselves to be more sensitive to pain than most people, compared to 39</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys and 57 percent of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other side of the ledger, 24 percent of the non-shy men considered themselves to be "a great deal less sensitive to pain than most people". Not one single man in <i class="calibre4"> either</i> of the two loveshy groups considered himself to be a great deal below average in physical pain sensitivity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In numerous cases great sensitivity to physical pain stimuli had caused some of the loveshy men a considerable amount of embarrassment. One of the younger loveshys told me about an incident that had taken place at Glacier National Park. This man had been part of a tour group of the outback that had been composed of people of both sexes and of all ages. And for quite a while during the course of a hike through a woodland area he found himself swatting his hands so incessantly and dramatically that he could not even hold on to his camera. There had been two elderly women in the group; and even they had not reacted to the mosquitos with anywhere nearly the extreme flailing and swatting movements that this loveshy man had displayed. He felt quite embarrassed by his behavior, and by the fact that he had been less able to deal with the mosquitos than anyone else in his tour group, including the old ladies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several stories of this nature suggest the possibility that <i class="calibre4"> allergic</i> <i class="calibre4">reactions</i> to insects may affect the loveshy to a considerably greater extent than they affect the non-shy. Further, such sensitivities may quite possibly be attributable to inborn, genetically rooted factors. Hopefully medical research will soon shed some light on this matter. Suffice it to say that such strong and conspicuous sensitivities in <i class="calibre4"> male</i> children are highly likely to attract bullies. Inordinate degrees of sensitivity to or fear of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"></a>4 0 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical pain can have an extremely negative affect upon a male's ability to get along successfully with his same-sexed peer group. Such fears can render a male child highly vulnerable to persistent bullying, and to the social avoidance patterns discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Fear of Pain in Medical Settings</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In view of the quite substantial number of often chronic medical problems from which the loveshy suffer, I found it especially interesting that the loveshy tended to visit medical doctors a good deal <i class="calibre4"> less often</i> than the non-shys. To be sure, there are many psychoneurotic people who visit medical doctors a great deal more often than the majority of the population. But all people with psychoemotional problems are NOT</p>
<p class="calibre1">alike! And it appears that one of the major identifying characteristics of loveshy men is that of <i class="calibre4"> under-visitation</i> with doctors at medical facilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the questions I asked of each man was: "I would avoid having a strongly recommended (but not absolutely required) surgical procedure performed on me because of fear of pain, discomfort, and being put to sleep." And 45 percent of the older loveshys along with 32 percent of the younger loveshys indicated "yes, that is true". In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> (not one single person) among the non-shy men indicated that the statement was true for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, almost one out of every two of the most severely loveshy men tend to fear potential pain so enormously that they would sacrifice their health and their physical well-being just in order to avoid entering a hospital for strongly recommended work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there may be some additional fears which account for this aversion to doctors and to medical facilities. For example, during the interviews some of the men shared with me their negative fantasies and worries about how they would be extremely nervous and shy about screaming and hollaring in pain with other people around. One of the most commonplace worries was that of being seen nude by the nursing staff. Urinating and defecating constituted another anxiety. As one man said to me:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wouldn't have the nerve to go to the bathroom. I mean they make you use these bedpan things when you are confined to your bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd never have the nerve to do that with the nurses and other people there! I think I'd just go insane because of the horrible lack of privacy!" (24-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">And some of the men recounted embarrassing scenes from their childhood days. Often these scenes related to an inability to "take" an injection without crying out in pain, whereas other children (including</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 401</p>
<p class="calibre1">girls) who were getting inoculations at the same time had remained silent and nonresponsive to any pain. The loveshys tended to remember their embarrassed feelings all too well. Indeed, remembered negative feelings from a very long time ago often haunted the loveshys to the point of distracting them from their involvement in productive pursuits such as work or study.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 37-year old loveshy man told me about how he could remember jumping on tables and chairs in doctors' offices in order to avoid being given necessary inoculations. In fact, several of the loveshys recalled having to be held down by parents and medical staff in order to receive required injections. In some cases this behavior had occurred as late as age 14 or 15.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the loveshys confessed that they break out in a cold sweat whenever they enter a physician's office for any reason. In essence, loveshy men tend to be inordinately nervous, and this often shows up even to the point wherein the medical staff comments upon it. Interestingly, a good predictive barometer that might be used to predict chronic loveshyness early in life is the knee-jerk response. One physician with whom I spoke commented that whenever he gives the knee-jerk test to a particularly shy or fearful male, the leg of that male will typically overreact, sometimes to an inordinate degree. Thus the tendency for the loveshy to quite automatically overreact in a hypernervous fashion seems to extend to all manner of things, including even the mild hitting of the knee with a rubber hammer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, loveshy males tend to have an extremely strong fear of pain and of anxiety. And these fears tend to keep them away from health care delivery systems for sometimes inordinate lengths of time. Despite their myriad medical symptoms, most of the loveshy obtain medical examinations only when these are absolutely required for employment or for some other education or career-related reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I found that this tendency to avoid medical services did not extend quite so strongly to the avoidance of dentists. Most of the loveshys had learned to relax to a sufficient extent upon the administration of nova-caine. Unfortunately, medical doctors seldom deal in local anesthetics.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it is this fear of loss of control brought about by the potential administration of a general anesthetic (and being placed on a breathing machine) that the loveshy especially strongly fear. And they also fear the severe pain and nausea that often accrues from being brought out of anesthesia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Curiously, none of the loveshys studied for this book had ever had a major surgical procedure performed on them. In essence, their worries were all rooted in what they had heard from others. Worries and fears rooted in personal experiences tended to be confined to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"></a>4 0 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">pains they recalled suffering as children upon being given required inoculations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I suggested in the preceding chapter, a good many of the loveshys may need a deviated septum and polypectomy procedure performed upon their noses and nasal cavities. Several of the older loveshys mentioned that such a procedure had been recommended to them, but that they had turned it down out of fear of pain and anxiety. Thus it is fair to assume that at least a few of the loveshys are permitting quite uncomfortable and socially debilitating medical conditions to remain uncorrected simply out of a fear of pain and of anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Miscellaneous Sensitivities</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the 500 respondents was asked about several other mis-cellaneous sensitivities. Obviously, there was no way for me to cover the gamut as far as this issue is concerned. Suffice it to say that every question I raised vis-a-vis each respondent revealed the loveshys to be substantially more sensitive than the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked each man to react to this statement: "It doesn't bother me much when a pair of rubbers are rubbed against each other (causing a squeek), or when chalk on a blackboard squeeks." Fully 60</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shys replied "yes, it does <i class="calibre4"> not</i> bother them". In contrast, only 16 percent of the older loveshy men and 36</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys could say that such squeeking sounds do <i class="calibre4"> not</i> bother them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this might seem like a "very little thing". But among elementary school and junior high school aged boys this sort of sensitivity is exactly the type of stimulus that invites bullying. In essence, the loveshys tended to have received more and more of the very things they hated and feared the most strongly. Usually such squeeking sounds caused the loveshys to experience painful chills up and down their spines. Non-shy people are significantly less likely to experience this painful sensation, although 40 percent of the non-shys studied for this book <i class="calibre4"> had</i> experienced it. Thus, even socially self-confident people have <i class="calibre4">some</i> sensitivities. Of course, in <i class="calibre4"> not overreacting</i> to such painful stimuli, the non-shys had not been forced to listen to as many such disconcerting squeeks as the loveshys had been forced to listen to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite related to the foregoing was the following statement: "I can't handle a certain type of expensive, glossy paper (some expensive Christmas cards and department store boxes are made of it) because it causes chills to run up and down my spine." This question may have been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p434"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 403</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat vague for some respondents. Nevertheless, fully 26 percent of the older loveshys and 15 percent of the younger loveshys responded in the affirmative. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> among the 200 non-shys interviewed indicated that they could not handle a certain kind of paper.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of considerably greater significance to the life of a typical male child was the following statement: "Most people seem to be able to enter cold water (such as a fresh water lake or ocean) a very great deal faster than I can." As I indicated in chapter six, many of the loveshys had enjoyed swimming a very great deal when they were children. Yet in spite of their enjoyment, they took much longer than most children to get used to (or "adapt to") cold water. And this had gotten quite a few of them into painful difficulties vis-a-vis their male peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In any event, fully 95 percent of the older loveshys and 69 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4"> agreed</i> with the statement. In contrast, only 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed that they required much longer than most people to enter cold water. Obviously, these differences are quite substantial; and they may well relate to basic differences in body chemistry between the loveshys and the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another question I asked for reactions to this statement: "I can't stand it when one of my fingernails becomes even the slightest bit rough."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And 57 percent of the older loveshys together with 40 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. In contrast, only 2 percent of the non-shy men agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another statement that was reacted to quite differently by the three samples of men was: "My eyelashes often seem to cause me itches and other discomforts." Fully 31 percent of the older loveshys together with 22 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men agreed. A related statement to which I elicited reactions was: "The corners of my eyes frequently itch." Here again, 56 percent of the older loveshys and 42 percent of the younger loveshys agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Zero percent</i> of the non-shy men agreed.</p>
