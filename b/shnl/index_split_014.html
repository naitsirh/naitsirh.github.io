<p class="calibre1">To be sure, I think that adult sons and daughters who <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> the single life style incur the wrath and displeasure of their aging mothers and fathers a great deal more frequently than women's liberation and pro-singlehood writers are predisposed to suggest. However, someone who <i class="calibre4"> did not choose</i> the single life style, but who is living it anyway because of a reason as nebulous and difficult for most people to understand as <i class="calibre4">loveshyness</i> (and as seemingly indicative of poor self-discipline and self-control), is far more likely to incur the wrath and displeasure of aging</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>202 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents than someone who had <i class="calibre4"> chosen</i> the single life style for reasons he/she is proud and happy to discuss. There is a celebrated cliche in the Bible which states: "By their fruits, so shall ye know them." The negative, unhappy ambiance of the loveshy man represents "fruits" about which aging parents find it very difficult to feel proud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every time I visit my folks I'm always reminded about how my two younger brothers are married, and about how they have such nice children. My 18-year old kid brother brags right in front of my parents about how he knocked up his wife in the chemistry lab one night when no one was around. Anyway, he <i class="calibre4"> had to</i> marry her, and he cost my parents and her parents a great deal of money and trouble. But everything is all forgiven with him because he has such a nice baby and I'm the black sheep everybody is ashamed to have for a brother. They wouldn't lift a finger to introduce me to any girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, they find it easier to just assume that I'm a fairy—and they just let it go at that. It's in their best financial interests. I mean, my father already told me that unless I get married neither he nor my mother are going to leave me anything. He even showed me his will. And that's what it says." (35-year old loveshy man with two younger married brothers.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness can quite clearly serve to alienate its victims from their siblings. A noteworthy minority of the loveshys had grown up in homes wherein all of the children had suffered frequent harassment at the hands of parents. In many such instances the children had "stuck together" through their respective childhood ordeals. But when they became adults, the loveshys' lack of heterosexual involvements served to gradually alienate them from brothers and sisters with whom they had formerly gotten along satisfactorily. The parents themselves may have had a good deal to do with this. In essence, while drawing up their wills the parents could not "see" leaving as much to progeny who did not appear to have any responsibilities of their own. It made more sense to leave money and property to children who had become parents themselves, and who seemed to be leading some semblance of a "normal" life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In learning of their aging parents' intentions, it seems likely that many of the loveshys' siblings had encouraged their parents' will-making resolve. After all, it was in accordance with their own vested interests to do so. Why, indeed, should a sibling without any family responsibilities receive as much from the parents' estate as those sons and daughters who had turned out "alright" in spite of everything?! Everybody loves a winner; and it is always easier to be good to people who are ostensibly happy and successful than it is to be good to those whose lives are bogged down by severe psychoemotional problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 203</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when they lived close by, the loveshys' aging parents never or almost never paid their sons any visits. In turn, the loveshys sometimes did visit their aging parents. But the frequency of these visits tended to be far less than the frequency of visitation experienced by the loveshys' married siblings. Moreover, when the loveshys did visit their aging parents the visits were often frought with friction. Often times the loveshys would prod their parents to provide introductions to young women; and that tended to create a great deal of friction. In almost all cases the aging parents tended to feel uncomfortable and quite disappointed about being seen publicly with their loveshy sons.3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Showers and Wedding Presents</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It appears fairly logical to assume that most of the loveshys' parents would be shy and lonely isolates themselves. But this is evidently not true. In fact, some of the loveshys' parents had quite a few friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And some of them interacted with their friends quite frequently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was in regard to these parental friendships that having a loveshy son tended to create a great deal of embarrassment and strong feelings of deprivation and disappointment. As would be expected, these feelings tended to have been most painful for those parents who had had an <i class="calibre4"> only child</i> who had turned out loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the parents had very frequently complained to their loveshy sons that they never had anything to brag about with their friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their friends were always boasting about the accomplishments of their sons and daughters. The loveshys' parents, on the other hand, could only hold their tongues on such occasions, and just feel depressed because of their own sons' lack of propitious progress and growth—particularly in the social area of life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, some of the loveshys' parents had spent a considerable amount of money on wedding gifts and shower presents for their friends' children. These parents, of course, expected to be able to revel in the joy of reciprocation when their own loveshy children got married.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When this never happened a great deal of bitterness and unhappiness was created in the lives of these aging parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every time I see my mother she reminds me of the hundreds of dollars she had spent on Judy's shower and Ted's wedding present and Nancy's wedding present, and so-and-so's shower, and on and on and on. All of this makes me feel even more depressed. I mean, if these people mean so fucking much to my Mom, why the fuck didn't she try to get them to introduce me to some women! When I was growing up she used to spend more fucking time with those fucking people than she ever spent with me. Now that she's old</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>2 0 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">and retired she still insists on upstaging me so that she can spend time with a new set of friends she now has. Neither she nor her fucking friends would ever do a goddam thing to help me to meet someone who might become a wife for me. So why should I feel guilty because my inability to marry means that my mother will not be able to see me receive all those valuable wedding presents in reciprocation for the wedding and shower presents that she gave!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shit! Let her find me a wife. Then I'll marry and she'll receive her reciprocation!" (50-year old loveshy "only child".)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, my parents are constantly reminding me about how embarrassed I make them feel. I am the only kid in all my parents' friends'</p>
<p class="calibre1">families who has not married. And every time I see them they remind me of that fact. They don't even allow me to come around anymore if there is a chance that any of their friends will be there. I have to phone them first before I come. Otherwise they say they'd be too embarrassed if their friends were there when I showed up. I don't know why! I keep fantasizing that maybe one of their friends might understand my problem and help me meet some women." (42-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, loveshyness very effectively prevents afflicted sons from bringing any real pleasure either to themselves or to their aging parents. Even though most of the loveshys had gotten along quite poorly with their parents throughout childhood and adolescence, presently as adults they did want to make their parents feel proud of them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But they were powerless to do this. The loveshy men tended to become the "black sheep" of their families—people who were viewed as best left forgotten or, at least, not talked about when non-family members are around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the loveshys had wanted a lover and marriage partner for many, many years prior to the time when their parents had first begun desiring these things for them. A wife and family was genuinely and truly the goal of each loveshy man who was studied for this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in most cases this had been their most cherished goal since the time they had been in the first or second grade of elementary school. If a loveshy man had not very strongly desired a wife and lover, it seems highly improbable that his parents' desire for him to obtain these things would have had any meaningful effect upon him at all. In short, these men wanted to get married <i class="calibre4"> for their own benefit. </i> The delight and "relief"</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their parents would merely have represented an attractive <i class="calibre4"> fringe benefit, </i> and nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is therefore quite clear that loveshyness brings sadness and unhappiness to more people than just the young men who are afflicted with the problem. There is a significant price to be paid whenever any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 205</p>
<p class="calibre1">human being is deprived of free choice and self-determination. Simply put,  <i class="calibre4"> responsible freedom for all</i> represents the safest, most happy and productive way of life for any society. And loveshyness is highly antithetical to that goal.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">"Get Me a Goose!" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite a few of both the younger and the older loveshys had tried to prod their parents into using their social connections to effect appropriate introduction to eligible young women. Many of these efforts on the loveshys' part had been quite forceful. And none had been successful. Many of the loveshys stood in bitter envy of various acquaintances whose parents and kinfolk had allegedly embarked upon <i class="calibre4"> unwanted</i> matchmaking efforts. They wanted their own parents to do the same thing for them. And in at least a few cases they were quite non-shy about prodding their parents in this regard. I quote the following interview at length because it illustrates quite well the difficult psychodynamics of intractable loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"After I had completed three years of graduate school I decided to take off a year. I thought I'd go back to Denver where my parents still lived, and see if I could force them to get me a girl. My father was a successful lawyer, and I knew that he must have had all sorts of connections in the local community. So I thought maybe I could get him to get me a wife. I was just getting more and more depressed all the time. And even though my grades were good and I had successfully completed a Masters degree, I knew that I would be much more effective if I had a wife. A lot of the students in my classes were already married. And I was just desperate. I was willing to just do anything to force my parents into doing something for me to get me a wife.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, up to that time I never had the nerve to say anything to my parents about my shyness problems. They thought I was just a slow starter, and like my mother would always keep saying to her friends that I had plenty of time, and I'd get over my bashfulness when the right woman came after me. Well, no woman had ever come after me. And my father kept telling me that I was really lucky. At the dinner table ever since I was a small kid he would tell me 'ahhh, never get married, kid!' He kept saying that even though he had been married to my mother for over 30 years without very much evident fighting or turmoil between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I had just turned 25 when I left my graduate school in Seattle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My parents gave me a really cool reception. They couldn't understand why I had turned down my student stipend and would want</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>2 0 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">to return to live with them. Both of them bitched away and bitched away at me to get a job and stop living at home with them. And I kept telling them that I'd leave as soon as they got me a 'goose'. I don't know why. But it was just much easier for me to use the word.</p>
<p class="calibre1">'goose' with them. I didn't have the nerve to say 'girl'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, they started getting madder than hell at me. Whenever they had company which was quite often, I would tack or scotch tape little announcements to the wallpaper or to the guests' cars which said: 'please get my parents to get me a goose! Mention this to my parents and they'll explain it'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I started doing all kinds of other stuff. Like after my parents went to bed I would take all the cans of food out of the kitchen cabinets, and pile them up one on top of the other, until they went from the floor to the cealing. And I would leave them balanced like that. My parents thought I was going nuts. And I just kept telling them that I wouldn't stop until they got me a goose. I mean I told them that they hadn't finished their responsibilities with me yet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though I was 25, they still had to get me a goose; then they would be finished with their child-rearing responsibilities with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like, there are societies all over the world where the parents take upon themselves the responsibility of finding geese for their children. Well, I thought I could force my parents too to get me a goose—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean 'wife'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, one time my father came home and told me that he might be able to get me a date with one of his secretaries. Actually I kind of liked the girl he had in mind. She was sort of pretty. But I had never met her. I mean, at a business meeting my father took me to he introduced me to her. But he didn't do anything to enable us to sit down and really get to know each other. I mean, I didn't have the nerve to say anything after I said 'hi'. She was busy mixing whiskey sours for all these businessmen. And I didn't have the nerve to go up and try to talk to her—although my father was creating something of a scene trying to force me. Like he just wasn't cool. If he could have only set something up where we would have to talk to each other without me feeling any anxiety, it would have been great.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, a few days later my father came home and told me that he had told this girl that she should be expecting a telephone call from me. And she had allegedly said 'great' to my father. So for the next several days my father was constantly at me to call. And believe me, I desperately wanted to call this girl because she did seem really nice. But I just couldn't bring myself to get up the nerve. I mean, what could I say? How would I even begin? I just couldn't handle the situation. And my father just became more and more pissed off at me. He kept telling me that I had embarrassed him at work because</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 207</p>
<p class="calibre1">this girl had been expecting me to call; and I didn't call. I kept telling my father that she was a really nice goose, but that he'd have to work something out that would make it easier for me to get involved in a conversation with her. Anyway, he just got to the point where he just kept telling me to go to hell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I wouldn't stop with my parents because I had told my classmates back at the U. of Washington that I was taking off a year to find a wife, and that I'd be returning as soon as I had found one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, I started doing all kinds of crazy things like putting a wet mop on my mother's living room broadloom, and overflowing the toilet bowl. One time when my parents weren't home I took a lot of my mother's stuff down to the pawn shop. I didn't need the money and I wasn't stealing anything because I gave them the pawn tickets and loan money as soon as they got home. I just told them that I wouldn't stop doing these things until they finally fulfilled their responsibilities with me and got me a goose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, my father had me arrested and I spent a night in jail. My father bailed me out the following morning even though he was the one who had me arrested. By this time I was just so frustrated and exasperated about my parents' unwillingness to do anything to help me that I decided to go back to graduate school. I mean even their friends didn't seem to notice all the pleas for help that I had left around in the form of these notes saying that I needed a goose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I finally went back to graduate school. But I had to go to Oregon instead of back to Washington—because I didn't have the nerve to face the kids and tell them that I hadn't made any progress at all in my quest for a wife." (39-year old loveshy man.) This case illustrates the fact that some severely loveshy men become quite "passive-aggressive" in their behavioral tendencies vis-a-vis their parents. On the surface these aggressive tendencies appear quite antithetical to shyness. But they are actually loud pleas for help. In the above case this is particularly apparent in this man's having left notes on the windshields of his parents' friends' automobiles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grossly immature behavior as well as chronic misbehavior are actually <i class="calibre4"> forms of disordered communication. </i> The person employs misbehavior as a form of communication when normal modes of communication are constantly ignored or when they simply fail to work. The loveshy male will often use these disordered modes of communication around people he knows well, such as parents, whose presence does not arouse the very low native anxiety-threshold that seems to universally characterize the chronic loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One problem with the "passive-aggressive" diagnosis is the fear that any genuine helping will actually serve to reinforce or strengthen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>2 0 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the "passive-aggressive" tendencies. I believe that this fear is unfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men use "passive-aggressive" behavior as a <i class="calibre4"> tool</i>—nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They use it as a tool to get their most basic love needs met. Once these needs are met—through being accorded a wife or lover—there is no longer any need for "passive-aggressive" conduct.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a later chapter I shall discuss "practice dating", which is the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> form of therapy which appears to have any constructive effects on loveshys. It is the only form of therapy which extinguishes heterosexual interaction anxieties and gets loveshy men involved in the actual dating and courting of women. Whereas conservative, traditional-minded clinicians perceive "practice-dating therapy" as encouraging passive-aggressive conduct, the available research data suggest that this form of therapy has just the opposite effect upon loveshy males. Loveshy men will <i class="calibre4"> not</i> benefit from either (1) the "talking cure" of traditional psychotherapy, or (2) from the "good swift kick in the ass" which many people would like to give them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, in regard to the idea of arranged marriages I included the following statement on each of the questionnaires:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would like to see arranged marriages available as an option in our society so that I could get married without having to suffer the indignity of having to ask women for dates."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 74 percent of the older loveshy men agreed with this statement, along with 56 percent of the younger loveshys. In stark contrast, <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shy men saw fit to agree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in a related question I asked each man to react to this statement: "If I could get married without ever having to go out on dates, I'd jump at the chance." And fully 53 percent of the older loveshys and 37 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. Again,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the 200 non-shy men agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Notes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. In his books THE ONE MINUTE FATHER and THE ONE MINUTE MOTHER, Dr. Spencer Johnson makes an especially important conceptual distinction between a child's <i class="calibre4"> being loved</i> and a child's subjectively <i class="calibre4"> feeling loved. </i> FEELING LOVED is of infinitely greater importance for a child's well-being and future socioemotional growth than is being loved. Almost all parents passionately assert that they "love" their children. And virtually all manner of abuse can be heaped on a child in the name of "real love", "caring and concern". Many "loved" children simply do not <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> loved; and as a result they fail to develop in a healthy manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. In point of fact, they may be <i class="calibre4"> less</i> happy and <i class="calibre4"> more</i> lonely. In his book THE BROKEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">HEART: THE MEDICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LONELINESS, James J. Lynch cites convincing evidence to the effect that the unmarried are a great deal more vulnerable than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>Parents as a Cause of Love-Shvness 209</p>
<p class="calibre1">the married to all manner of medical and psychiatric problems. His data show that this is particularly true for men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. In 1984 a new kind of support group developed which calls itself <i class="calibre4"> "Parents of Gay</i> <i class="calibre4">and Lesbian Children". </i> This group has proved very beneficial in helping its members with a whole host of problems such as those pertaining to coming to an honest acceptance and compassionate understanding of their sons and daughters, coming to grips with not being able to have grandchildren (where this is applicable), <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> I would suggest that a strong effort should be made to develop a support group called <i class="calibre4"> "Parents of LoveShy Heterosexuals". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, in addition to a national network of <i class="calibre4"> Shys Anonymous</i> organizations, a companion network of parents of young men who are victims of severe loveshyness would be most beneficial. Like the parents of homosexuals, the parents of loveshy heterosexuals must similarly (very often) deal with permanent or long-term deprivation of the opportunity to have grandchildren. And the parents of heterosexual loveshys have as much difficulty as those of homosexuals in coming to a compassionate understanding of their children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, an effective network of parent support groups might even prove somewhat helpful in getting loveshy sons introduced to eligible women.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>
<a id="p242"></a>Chapter 9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Family as a Hotbed of Rage</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">and Belittlement</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger and rage are commonly understood by psychologists as a response to being hurt emotionally, and of being made to feel unimportant. Despite the widely accepted cliche that "actions speak louder than words", people tend to be less courteous to members of their own immediate family than they tend to be with total strangers or chosen friends. Moreover, they tend to be less courteous and respectful vis-avis their "flesh and blood" children than they tend to be vis-a-vis their spouses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In American society we tend to think of the chronically mischievous, hyperactive male child as inspiring the most frequent episodes of anger and rage from his parents. My own suspicion is that the normally sociable, highly active, mischievous lad may be much easier for most parents to understand (and hence to handle), than the fearful, anxiety-prone, socially inhibited boy. The former is much easier than the latter for a parent to understand because the former more nearly approximates the traditional stereotype as to what a "real boy" should be like. People tend to fear and to display hostility toward those things which they do not understand. And there is a great deal about the behavior of a severely shy male child that might well be beyond the average parent's capability for understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In their studies of child abuse many sociologists have been able to show that the <i class="calibre4"> exceptional child</i> tends to be far more vulnerable to severe physical and psychoemotional abuse than any of his more "normal"</p>
<p class="calibre1">siblings. And even though I was not able to interview any of the brothers or sisters of the loveshy men, the impression was quite consistently driven home to me that the loveshys had been treated in a far more psychologically and physically callous way by their parents than the non-shys had ever been. Moreover, the loveshys tended to be in surprisingly consistent agreement that their siblings had been treated better by the parents than they themselves had been. Indeed, fully 81 percent 2 1 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>2 1 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the older loveshys (who had grown up with siblings) together with 73 percent of the younger loveshys felt that their brothers and sisters had been accorded better treatment than they themselves had been accorded. In contrast, only 5 percent of the non-shy men felt this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Temper and Rage</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The thing which differentiated the parents of the loveshy from those of the non-shy more sharply than anything else was what might be termed the <i class="calibre4"> rage and irascibility factor. </i> The loveshys' parents were remembered as being especially fast to display their tempers. For example, 53 percent of the older loveshy men together with 47 percent of the younger ones agreed with the statement: "My mother was always easily angered and very prone to outbursts of temper." Among the non-shy men only 20 percent agreed. Further, 41 percent of the older loveshys along with 36 percent of the younger ones agreed that their <i class="calibre4"> fathers</i> were always easily angered and very prone to outbursts of temper.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the non-shys just 21 percent agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the statements to which each respondent reacted was: "My mother often threw uncontrollably loud, angry temper tantrums at me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 45 percent of the older loveshy men indicated that this had happened "frequently" or "sometimes", compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shy men. Among the younger loveshys, 39 percent indicated that it happened "frequently" or "sometimes". On the other side of the ledger, 73 percent of the non-shys indicated that it <i class="calibre4"> never</i> happened. Only 30 percent of the older loveshys and 39 percent of the younger ones similarly indicated that it had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> happened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, almost all parents lose their "cool" with their children from time to time. This is very natural. In fact, it is part of being human.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, parental rages seemed to have left an indelible mark upon the minds of the loveshys whereas the non-shy men seemed to have largely forgotten such incidents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The memory of parental swearing may similarly have faded from the minds of most of the non-shy respondents. In response to the statement: "When I was a child my <i class="calibre4"> father</i> would very often swear, hollar and cus at me," 40 percent of the older loveshys and 35 percent of the younger ones indicated "true". Only 14 percent of the non-shy men similarly indicated "true". In response to the statement: "When I was a child my <i class="calibre4"> mother</i> would very often swear, hollar and cus at me," 48</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys together with 37 percent of the younger ones indicated "true". Among the non-shys only 6 percent said "true".</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I asked "Has either of your parents ever come after you with a knife?" 16 percent of the older loveshys and 11 percent of the younger</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement  2 1 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones said "yes".  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shy men said "yes". And in response to the statement: "My mother would often scream that she wished I would die or that I was dead," fully 38 percent of the older loveshys and 30 percent of the younger ones indicated that this had happened on several occasions. Only 3 percent of the non-shys indicated that it had <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> happened to them. As a case in point, one of the young loveshys recounted the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, every time I go home for a holiday my mother turns really rabid after a few days. She does things like screaming that she can't understand why so many nice kids get killed in automobile accidents and plane crashes while a dirty rotten sonofabitch like me is permitted to live. Ha! Ha! Ha! I mean, she always really says that! Last time I was back there she asked me point blank—why don't I just take my car and crash it into a tree somewhere at 90 miles an hour!</p>
<p class="calibre1">She says I'd be doing her and the rest of society a favor, and that I wouldn't have to suffer anymore either  . . . . I've never had any suicidal wishes myself. I do feel depressed about the fact that I can't get a girl. But I think my feeling is to a much greater extent one of anger, than of depression. Like I enjoy my studies here at the university. I just get pissed off about the fact that society won't allow me to have a girlfriend just because I'm shy and because I'm not a nervy person." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the men in any of the three samples seemed able to recall their <i class="calibre4"> fathers</i> doing or saying strange or bizarre things. However, some of the fathers were remembered by the loveshys as having been quite punitive and prone to fits of rage. Many of the loveshys recalled their fathers' frequent expressions of disappointment about having an</p>
<p class="calibre1">"unmasculine" or "inadequately masculine" boy for a son. And in families where there had been more than one son, the loveshys remembered their fathers as having been a great deal more kindly and friendly in their interactions with the more "masculine" brother. Indeed, this had been true even in several cases where the more "masculine" brother had been an inferior student and had gotten himself into frequent scrapes of one kind or another at school. Thus, misbehavior in the favored or more "masculine" son was more likely to have been overlooked and forgiven by the loveshys' fathers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Spankings, Beatings, and Physical Abuse</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the 300 loveshy men interviewed for this book had ever had their bones broken by their parents. None had ever been beaten black and blue, or to the point of being bloodied up. None had ever been thrown into scalding water or placed atop a red hot radiator or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>2 1 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">stove, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In other words, dramatic instances of bizarre forms of <i class="calibre4"> physical</i> child abuse or neglect are evidently not very common among the ranks of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the problem with the available literature on child abuse is that it focuses only on "the tip of the iceberg"—on cases that are maximally dramatic and bizarre. The metaphor of an iceberg is a very useful one in considering the issue of child abuse. Eight-ninths of an iceberg is inconspicuous and unapparent because it lies buried beneath the surface of the sea. In spite of the burgeoning in the reported cases of child abuse today, the vast majority of instances go unreported. Milder forms of abuse, which over the years can have an enormously deleterious cumulative impact upon a child, virtually never reach the attention of public officials.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Males who remain "single, never married" beyond the age of 30, have been found by numerous researchers to have had more stressful childhoods than any other major category of people. As far as loveshy men are concerned, there is no question but that a very uncomfortable family <i class="calibre4"> and</i> peer group life constituted the major sources of stress. For many of the loveshys interviewed for this book, family stressors never abated. An abusive peer group situation can ordinarily be escaped for long periods— except for instances involving involuntary confinement in a summer camp. In contrast, no child can ever escape his family for very long. A child's dependence upon his parents for food, clothing and shelter obviates his escaping for very long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The interview data I obtained clearly indicated that <i class="calibre4"> psychoemotional</i> <i class="calibre4">abuse</i> represented a far more pervasive factor in the family backgrounds of the loveshy men than did physical abuse. Of course, psychoemotional abuse <i class="calibre4"> is child abuse</i> in every sense of the term. Unlike physical abuse, psychoemotional abuse is almost never detected, much less stopped, by outside officials in the school or local community. Yet such abuse carries an enormous toll; and one manifestation of this toll is quite clearly that of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the fact that psychoemotional abuse was the major theme as far as the family backgrounds of the loveshys were concerned, physical assaults on the loveshys by mothers and fathers had been quite commonplace. Psychologist Hans Eysenck has shown that highly inhibited, sensitive children ordinarily require a far below average amount of discipline because they learn <i class="calibre4"> (when they are CAPABLE of learning)</i> socially acceptable behavior patterns faster and more thoroughly than extroverts do. And unlike extroverts, once they do learn something, they find it extremely difficult to <i class="calibre4"> unlearn</i> it, even when it is appropriate for them to do so. Yet the loveshy men who were studied for this book had received a great deal <i class="calibre4"> more</i> of all forms of "discipline" than the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement  2 1 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-confident non-shys. And this had been as true for spankings, beating, and other forms of physical punishment, as it had been for loud, angry, ego-deflating scoldings. And when the loveshys had been beaten, loud shouting and screaming and abusive hollaring on the part of the "disciplining" parent had been invariably an integral part of the scenario.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, 22 percent of the self-confident, non-shy men claimed that their parents had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> used corporal punishment. This was true for <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys. In both the older and the younger groups,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the loveshy men had received at least some corporal punishment during their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the other end of the spectrum, 21 percent of the self-confident non-shys had been spanked or beaten on an average of at least <i class="calibre4"> once or</i> <i class="calibre4">more every ten days</i> throughout their formative years of childhood. In stark contrast, fully 44 percent of the younger loveshys and 58 percent of the older loveshys had been beaten or spanked on an average of at least once every ten days.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, what constitutes "spanking" or "beating" is very much a question of semantics. The word "spank" is widely used by abusive parents as a euphamism for severe beating and for other forms of psychoemotionally painful abuse. For this reason I asked the respondents about the impliments their parents had used for beating them. And in this regard the parents of the loveshy had been a great deal more indiscriminate in the "weapons" or impliments they chose than the non-shys' parents had been. Better than three-quarters of all groups of parents had relied upon their bare hands most of the time. However, 82</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the loveshys' parents (both groups) had relied heavily upon the use of belts; 56 percent of the parents of the non-shys had occasionally used belts, although these were used considerably less frequently by the non-shys' parents than by those of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nineteen percent of the loveshys' parents (both groups) had occasionally used razor straps; none of the non-shys had mentioned razor straps. On the other hand, 14 percent of the non-shys' parents had occasionally used hairbrushes, compared to 21 percent of the parents of the loveshys (both groups). Straps were mentioned by 62 percent of the loveshys (both groups), compared to just 31 percent of the non-shys. Wooden rulers were used occasionally by 39 percent of the parents of the loveshys (both groups), compared to just 15 percent of the parents of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sticks or birch rods were mentioned by 38 percent of the loveshys (both groups), compared to just 7 percent of the non-shys. And whereas none of the non-shys claimed to have ever been beaten with heavy wooden paddle boards, these were mentioned by 33 percent of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>2 1 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshy men. Dog leashes were similarly mentioned by 19 percent of the loveshys, but by <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the non-shys. And 12 percent of the loveshys had been beaten with wooden coat hangers; none of the non-shys had ever been beaten with same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the major difference between the loveshys and the non-shys is that corporal punishment had become an integral part of the normal way of life in <i class="calibre4"> at least half</i> of the loveshys' homes. This had been true for little more than <i class="calibre4"> one-fifth</i> of the homes from which the non-shys had come. In essence, the loveshys' parents were a good deal more likely than those of the non-shys to have learned throughout their own formative years to respond immediately to frustration, annoyance and wrongdoing in a <i class="calibre4"> physical</i> manner. It would thus appear that the loveshys had grown up with parents who had always had an above average amount of difficulty with impulse control.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For this reason, when aroused to anger and rage the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents had been much more likely than those of the non-shys to reach for any object or impliment that might have been immediately at hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, several of the loveshys recounted bizarre stories about all manner of household objects (sometimes even very valuable household objects) being thrown or used to inflict pain. Silverware and dishes were very often employed by the loveshys' parents as flying missiles. However, worthless objects were occasionally thrown as well. If a bag of garbage waiting to be taken out happened to be sitting on the kitchen counter during a temper tantrum, the mother might grab and throw that—quite irrespective of the mess that it made. One of the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">mothers had become so enraged one time when she happened to be sitting on the toilet that she picked up her waste and threw it at her son.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These spontaneous, uncontrolled displays of parental rage constitute another reason why the loveshys were much more likely than the non-shys to be punished with other adults and/or children immediately present upon the scene. Rage often made the loveshys' parents (especially the mothers) lose contact with reality to the point where they would say or scream anything, no matter how bizarre or horrendous it might be. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the loveshys' parents did deliberately wish to inflict as much humiliation upon their sons as they possibly could—with the conscious hope that such humiliation might shock their wayward son "into line". As a case in point, 28 percent of the older loveshys and 23 percent of the younger ones claimed that when they were of elementary school age their buttocks were often bare when they were beaten by their parents. This had been the case for only 2 percent of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another major difference between the homes of the loveshys and those of the non-shys is that the <i class="calibre4"> mother</i> tended to be seen by the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement  2 1 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshys as having been the major source of discipline and punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, 47 percent of the older loveshys and 38 percent of the younger ones agreed that the mother had done <i class="calibre4"> mostly all</i> of the punishing in the family. Contrariwise, this had been true for only 6 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of these differences, it seems quite possible that the mothers' basic nature and behavioral style may have helped significantly to set the stage for (1) the loveshys' strong fears concerning informal interaction with women, and (2) their basic, underlying nervousness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, experimental psychology has clearly taught us that introverts and low anxiety threshold people condition much faster and more deeply than extroverts. Living on a day-to-day basis with an enormously high strung woman certainly could not have done anything positive in terms of promoting a relaxed, easy-going ability to relate in a friendly way with women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A good example of the nervousness evoked by these mothers can be seen in the following interview segment:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes when my mother was mad, which was most of the time, she would take me by surprise. Like I'd be sitting at the dinner table, and she'd be getting ready to dish out some mashed potatoes from a pot that was sitting on the stove. Well, a lot of times she would take her wooden serving spoon and clobber me over the head with it as she was serving the mashed potatoes. I'd have mashed potatoes all over my head, and there would be mashed potatoes on the floor, and it would be a real mess. A lot of times she would scald me with hot water or with some other hot thing she was serving. It got to the point that every time she passed my seat with something she was serving, I'd duck and wince. And sometimes other people there would laugh at me for doing  t h a t . . . . I've been embarrassed several times. I mean sometimes even today as an adult I'd be sitting in a restaurant waiting for my meal. And when the waitress starts putting stuff on my plate I'd duck. I've been asked about that several times, but I don't say anything. Anyway, it never seems to happen when a man is serving me—only if it's a woman." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to indicate how old he had been the last or most recent time one of his parents had inflicted any physical punishment upon him. And the differences between the three groups of research respondents was quite substantial. The average age for the cessation of corporal punishment for the <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> men was 11.6. For the young loveshy men, on the other hand, the average age had been 15.9.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The average age when the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshys had stopped receiving corporal punishment was 17.2.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>2 1 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">When People "Stop Behaving" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous research investigations have revealed that when people are subjected to arbitrary and capricious punishment they typically <i class="calibre4"> stop</i> <i class="calibre4">behaving. </i> In essence, they don't do anything. Much like the schizophrenic, they stop responding to their environment. Cessation of overt behavior is a commonplace response in situations where (1) "good"</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior is seldom recognized or rewarded in any meaningful way, (2) wherein "bad" behavior meets with arbitrary and capricious punishment incorporating steady doses of hazing, bullying and belittling, and (3) wherein the desired or "good" behavior is beyond the intellectual or psychoemotional capabilities of the individual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key finding of this entire research study is that the mothers of the loveshy (and to a lesser extent also the fathers) tended to be unusually capricious in their angry temper tantrums, in their irascible, truculent remarks and psychoemotional hazing, and in their administration of punishment and discipline. The behavioral inertia that is inherent in the loveshyness condition may be construed as a kind of <i class="calibre4"> withholding of</i> <i class="calibre4">behavior</i>—of <i class="calibre4"> any</i> behavior. Indeed, the inability of the loveshy to take risks vis-a-vis members of the opposite sex whom they deem attractive</p>
<p class="calibre1">' may similarly be viewed as a sort of "nonbehaving". Moreover, it may represent a kind of "transfer" of nonbehaving from the mother to women in general out in the wider social environment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The family has long been recognized as constituting a kind of microcosm of the rest of society. People who become used to disordered patterns of intrafamily interaction (1) grow to <i class="calibre4"> emotionally</i> expect similar disordered, arbitrary and capricious patterns of communication outside the family; and they respond within such outside social contexts accordingly. And (2) they may gradually come to develop a brain biochemistry that is different from that of the rest of us, and which is supportive of schizoid, socially withdrawing behavior. Recent research has suggested that long-term involvement in certain types of stressful environmental situations may help to alter the brain's biochemical composition. Presently ongoing research may soon provide us with more definitive answers in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Corporal Punishment's Negative Consequences</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A book could easily be written summarizing all of the research activity that has been conducted pertinent to corporal punishment. Thus my discussion here will necessarily be kept brief and succinct. The main</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement  2 1 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">point I wish to make is that in spite of the widespread popularity of corporal punishment in the United States, hundreds of research studies are all in unanimous consensus on the points that (1) corporal punishment <i class="calibre4"> defeats</i> the purpose of discipline, and (2) it entails a host of very deleterious consequences upon both the child and the parent-child relationship. Readers desiring a good summary of the undesirable consequences of corporal punishment should read my article on the subject in HUMAN BEHAVIOR magazine. (See the bibliography for Gilmartin, 1979.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The research findings concerning this most important child-rearing topic can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) Corporal punishment is a self-image/self-esteem lowerer. The more frequent the reliance by the parents upon corporal punishment, the lower a child's self-esteem is likely to be, and the <i class="calibre4">less positive</i> his <i class="calibre4"> mental attitude</i> is likely to become.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) Corporal punishment undermines the ability of parents to constructively influence their children. People <i class="calibre4"> (including children)</i> tend to be most thoroughly influenced in situations wherein they can relax and let down their defensive guard. Corporal punishment creates social distance between parent and child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) Actions speak louder than words. Corporal punishment teaches violence and psychopathic behavior and attitudes. The psychopath doesn't care about the needs and feelings of others because his own needs and feelings had never been shown any genuine concern. Frequently spanked children tend to become either extremely aggressive and bullying towards their peers, or they tend to become extremely passive. Among criminals, the more violent and frequent the criminal behavior, the more frequently and severely that criminal is likely to have beeen beaten by his parents. In general, criminals had received far more corporal punishment than non-criminals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) A history of corporal punishment has been found to be strongly associated with husband-wife violence and with child abuse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(5) Corporal punishment discourages the development of <i class="calibre4"> internal</i> self-control. It makes people become overly dependent on <i class="calibre4"> external</i> forms of control. For this reason, frequency and severity of corporal punishment has been found to be inversely associated with social mobility. In other words, frequently whipped children stand a below average chance of (1) getting a good education, even if they have the native intelligence, and (2) getting and keeping a good, white-collar, middle or upper-middle-class occupational career. .,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>2 2 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">(6) Fear of pain has been found to bear <i class="calibre4"> no relationship</i> to long-term obedience. Studies have been done with children born with a rare gene that makes them incapable of experiencing pain. Except for their inability to feel pain, these children are quite normal in all respects. In fact, these children have been found to behave themselves just as well, and to grow up just as responsibly, as children of the same ages who are capable of feeling pain. For both (1) the children who <i class="calibre4"> could</i> feel pain, and (2) for those who could <i class="calibre4"> not</i> feel pain, whether or not the children were spanked had no relationship to acceptability of behavior. For <i class="calibre4"> both</i> groups of children the only factor which <i class="calibre4"> did</i> give rise to good behavior was a harmonious, emotionally satisfying parent-child bond.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, old traditions die hard. And corporal punishment <i class="calibre4"> is</i> an old tradition in the United States. In the years to come it is certainly to be hoped that our public high schools will (1) educate young people in a sufficiently detailed way as to the adverse consequences of physical punishment, and (2) provide systematic training based upon role playing (psychodrama) of constructive and effective ways of handling interpersonal conflict within the family.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Persistent Belittlement and Ego Deflation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychoemotional abuse usually doled out in extreme anger was the major complaint that the loveshys had against their parents. This ego-deflating hollaring and screaming was an <i class="calibre4"> everyday occurrence</i> in the homes of most of the loveshys. From the time the loveshys were very small children, the hollaring and screaming and shouting of belittling and highly disparaging labels was something with which they had always had to live—until they finally moved out of their parents' homes, usually to attend a university. Some of the loveshys told me that they thought they had immunized themselves against the rantings and ravings of their parents. But given the fact that throughout their formative years they had had to reside within such a highly charged home atmosphere, the absence of a deleterious cumulative effect seems most unlikely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider, for example, the ways in which some of the loveshys respond even today to their parents' rages. Several of the men I interviewed mentioned that they cannot stop themselves from breaking into an uncontrolled spasm of hysterical laughter whenever one of their parents displays a temper tantrum. Others simply escape the situation by locking themselves into their bedrooms until the tantrum subsides.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still others admit that even with their university educations they cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement 221</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop themselves from becoming depressed whenever they have to listen to their parents rant and rave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And some of them still witness their parents' rages from time to time. According to my interview data even the older loveshys occasionally visit with their aging parents. Of course, these visits are primarily one-sided: the loveshy man visits his parents; the parents seldom or never visit him. The <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> 19-24-year old men were visited by their parents on an average of <i class="calibre4"> five times more frequently</i> than the loveshy 19-24-year olds were visited. And the older loveshy men were scarcely ever visited at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Curiously, some level of partial financial dependence appeared to be a major motive for many of these visits. Some of the loveshys continue even in their 30s and 40s to receive some level of financial support from their parents. The loveshys would visit their parents' home and receive money along with heavy doses of angry, psychoemotional abuse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these loveshys figured that the abuse was simply "the price"</p>
<p class="calibre1">they had to pay for the money they were getting. Some of the fathers did not like the way their loveshy sons were dressing, or the sort of employment (many were underemployed) they were holding. Many of the fathers were still very upset about their adult sons' lack of competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">"masculine" drive. In essence, while the fathers were berating their loveshy sons for holding menial, "dead end" jobs, for dressing shabbily, and for not having any kind of a social life (not "settling down", having a family, etc.), they would simultaneously give them various sums of money.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout their formative years the basic keynote of the psychoemotional abuse the loveshys had received from parents was <i class="calibre4"> persistent belittlement and ego deflation. </i> As I shall show in the next chapter, this is the same sort of treatment they had been forced to accept throughout their formative years from their <i class="calibre4"> same-sexed peer group. </i> American society provides no systematic training on the crucially important matter of how to parent. We assume that competent parenting "comes natural", whereas, in point of fact,  <i class="calibre4"> it does not</i>—especially when a parent is charged with the responsibility of raising a difficult or unusual child. And <i class="calibre4"> pre-love-shy boys are unusual children. </i> (Highly effective approaches to parenting <i class="calibre4"> do</i> exist; interested readers should consult P.E.T. IN ACTION, and PARENT-EFFECTIVENESS TRAINING, both by Dr. Thomas Gordon. Dr. Spencer Johnson's ONE MINUTE MOTHER and ONE MINUTE</p>
<p class="calibre1">FATHER should also be considered "must" reading.) Most of the loveshys' parents probably did what they thought was best for their sons. I suspect that many of them felt "hurt" by the non-masculine behavior of their sons, and by their sons' intractable and seemingly <i class="calibre4"> deliberate</i> unwillingness to "straighten up and fly right" as a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>2 2 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"real boy" </i> should. The more refractory and nonresponsive the sons became towards the methods of discipline imposed, the more exasperated, hurt and enraged the parents became. All people like to have control over their lives and over their environments. The loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">behavior tended to make their parents feel powerless; and that is a very painful and emotionally disconcerting way for anyone to feel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, a central part of the problem was that the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents could not accept their sons as they were. Certain of the changes the parents had demanded were most probably beyond the native capacities of the loveshy sons. On the other hand, it seems probable that a great deal of constructive change <i class="calibre4"> which might have been feasible</i> had been unintentionally prevented from happening. Simply put, the parents had, by their actions, defeated their purpose. Their actions had served to prevent <i class="calibre4"> feasible</i> change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A child must <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> unconditionally accepted and loved <i class="calibre4"> as he is</i> before realistically feasible change can begin to come about.1 I am using the word "loved" here with a very precise meaning in mind.  <i class="calibre4"> Love</i> can be manifested and displayed only via <i class="calibre4"> communication which reflects a genuine</i> <i class="calibre4">sensitivity to and compassion for the needs and feelings of the loved one. </i> This is the true operational essence of what "love" is all about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the experiencing of such "true love" would not have proved sufficient to have turned the pre-love-shy boys into highly energetic, "rough and tumble" oriented, "regular" little boys. However, I believe that it most definitely <i class="calibre4"> would</i> have proved sufficient to prevent sensitive children from becoming loveshy, unhappy and poorly adjusted adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Children with the inhibition and low anxiety threshold genes <i class="calibre4"> can</i> grow up to have a collection of good friends, marriage, career success, and a strongly positive self-image, provided that they are accorded this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"love" </i> and acceptance when they are in the process of growing up. Again, you cannot get a duck out of a swan's egg. But you can have a mighty healthy, happy, well adjusted <i class="calibre4"> swan</i> if you accept your swan as a swan, instead of shouting him down all the time in the vain hope that your shouting will somehow inspire him into becoming something else—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which he can never do.  <i class="calibre4"> Love</i> as defined above, and unconditional acceptance, are the <i class="calibre4"> fertilizer</i> for propitious human growth and development.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sooner all people can be taught this message, the sooner our world will become a safer, happier, more productive and harmonious place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard,  <i class="calibre4"> patience</i> had not been a virtue among the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents. Fully 51 percent of the non-shys agreed with the statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My <i class="calibre4"> father</i> was always a patient person." In stark contrast, only 11</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys and 3 percent of the older ones saw fit to agree. Regarding the <i class="calibre4"> mothers, </i> 54 percent of the non-shy men</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>The Family as a Hotbed of Rage and Belittlement  2 2 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered theirs as having been patient. In contrast, only 13 percent of the older loveshys and 19 percent of the younger loveshys recalled their mothers as having been patient people.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Argument Initiation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to indicate which of his two parents usually started an argument with the other parent. This type of question is, of course, totally dependent upon subjective memory. But it is what a person subjectively thinks and believes that impacts upon him,  <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">what the objective facts might have been. Thus it is particularly instructive to note that fully 74 percent of the older loveshy men recalled their <i class="calibre4">mothers</i> as having "always" or "usually" been the argument initiator vis-a-vis the father. Among the younger loveshys 62 percent recalled their mothers as having normally been the one to start arguments with the father, not vice versa. In contrast, only 33 percent of the non-shy men saw their mothers as having been the usual argument starter vis-a-vis the father. In other words, in the non-shys' families when there was an argument the father was recalled as having been more likely than the mother to have started it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, I permitted each of the respondents to check an alternative to the mother/father argument question which read: "I never observed my parents arguing." Not very many respondents checked that alternative. Nevertheless, 29 percent of the non-shy men <i class="calibre4"> did</i> check it, compared to only 5 percent of the older loveshys and 9 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Doesn't All of This Contradict the Genetic</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Perspective? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the highly dissonant and often quite tumultuous family backgrounds of the loveshy, it would be easy to conclude that genetic factors are not responsible for very much. Such a conclusion, of course, would be quite false. Throughout this book I have taken the position that severe loveshyness is a byproduct of a synergistic interaction between genetic, karmic, and social learning factors. For example, the mothers and fathers of the typical loveshy man studied for this book had not responded as favorably or as kindly to him as they had vis-a-vis his more normally appearing brothers and sisters. Karmic and genetic (plus congenital) factors determine the social stimulus value of a boy, as per the discussion</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>2 2 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">in chapter four. When a boy's social stimulus value is at marked variance from what family and community norms suggest a boy should be like, that boy will typically <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be accepted as he is. Indeed, he is far more likely to be disparaged and rejected than would be the case if he were</p>
<p class="calibre1">"normal" (as defined by community norms) in terms of social stimulus value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with the inhibition and low anxiety threshold genes condition (learn) much faster and more thoroughly than extroverts, ambiverts, and high anxiety threshold people do. And it is especially for this reason that an adverse family background would be expected to do far greater damage to the "thin-skinned", pre-love-shy male than it would to the vast majority of the rest of us who had been born with "thicker skin".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the pre-love-shy learn self-related ideas much faster and more deeply and intractably than most people do, they are as a consequence less resiliant than most people. In essence, the shy retain adverse conditioning whereas most of the rest of us can fairly easily shake it off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The adverse conditioning (learning) which the loveshy receive from their families and peer groups serves to strengthen and reinforce the undesirable social stimulus value with which they started out. Thus the vicious cycle is perpetuated, and the loveshy male sinks ever more deeply and hopelessly into the quagmire of an ever worsening social stimulus value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus a human being enters the world with a constellation of <i class="calibre4"> elastic</i> limits. These elastic limits become progressively less and less elastic and to an increasing extent fully crystallized and etched in cement to the extent that their owner is consistently labeled and to the extent that he internalizes the disparaging label.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Notes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. In his books THE ONE MINUTE FATHER and THE ONE MINUTE MOTHER, Dr. Spencer Johnson makes an especially important conceptual distinction between a child's <i class="calibre4"> being loved</i> and a child's subjectively <i class="calibre4"> feeling loved. </i> FEELING LOVED is of infinitely greater importance for a child's well-being and future socioemotional growth than is being loved. Almost all parents passionately assert that they "love" their children. And virtually all manner of abuse can be heaped on a child in the name of "real love", "caring and concern". Many "loved" children simply do not <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> loved; and as a result they fail to develop in a healthy manner.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>Chapter 10</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness and the All-Male</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Peer Group</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout their lives the loveshys had experienced significantly fewer friendships than had the non-shys; and the few friendships that a minority of them had experienced had been very shallow. In fact, most of the loveshy men I interviewed for this book had been social isolates or "loners" throughout most periods of their lives. For example, I asked each man: "When you were growing up, how many people <i class="calibre4"> close to your</i> <i class="calibre4">own age, </i> and whom you felt free to contact, did you have readily available to you to help you deal with school and the various other problems and anxieties associated with growing up?" The differences in the pattern of responses between the three groups of men were quite substantial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 83 percent of the older loveshy men and 65 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they had had <i class="calibre4"> no one. </i> In contrast, this had been the case for <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident non-shy men studied. In fact, 57 percent of the non-shys indicated that they had had at least three or more close friends throughout their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 11 percent of the younger loveshys and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys could say that they had had three or more close friends throughout the duration of their formative years. In addition, 73 percent of the older loveshys together with 53 percent of the younger ones agreed with the much more extreme statement: "Throughout most of my life, I never had any friends."  <i class="calibre4"> Nobody</i> among the non-shy men agreed with that statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to tap the level of satisfaction each respondent felt with his <i class="calibre4"> current</i> situation I simply asked the following: "In general, do you feel that you have as many friends of the various kinds as you would like?" And 94 percent of the non-shy men indicated "yes", compared to a mere 8 percent of the university loveshys, and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This social distance which the loveshy feel vis-a-vis the human race apparently extends even to relatives and kin. I asked each man: 2 2 5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>2 2 6 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many relatives do you see often and consider close friends?" And 84 percent of the older loveshys together with 68 percent of the younger ones said "zero" or "nobody", compared to just 26 percent of the self-confident non-shys. In stark contrast, fully 45 percent of the non-shys saw <i class="calibre4"> "four or more" </i> relatives often and considered them close friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the case for <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of both the older and the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The basic premise of this chapter is that loveshy men learn very early in life to associate feelings of fear, anxiety and physical pain, with the mere idea of informal interaction amid an all-male peer group. The data which I shall review in this chapter strongly support this basic premise. Moreover, they point to a most pathetic poignancy in the lives of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most human beings look forward with considerable enthusiasm to opportunities for friendly, informal interaction with peers. In fact, most people learn very early in life to associate friendly socializing with keen pleasure. Being placed in solitary confinement has long been recognized as the most cruel and extreme of all punishments. When all other pleasures have been removed, most people still manage to experience considerable positive feelings from talking with and from sharing ideas with their friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the years numerous psychologists have focused upon the determinants of happiness. And the one common denominator to emerge from most of these studies is that satisfaction with informal friendships constitutes for most people the single, most important predictor of happiness. The feeling that one is "in the driver's seat" of one's own life has been found by a minority of researchers to surpass "friendships" as a determinant of happiness. But most studies of happiness have clearly demonstrated that <i class="calibre4"> involvement in meaningful roles and relationships with</i> <i class="calibre4">friends and family</i> constitutes the single, most important determinant of happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the fact that most of us associate the idea of friendly peer group interaction with feelings of pleasure, it is doubtless of formidable significance that the loveshy associate the idea of male peers with pain, fear and anxiety. Indeed, the very idea of play within the all-male peer group often conjures up so many strongly displeasureable feelings for the loveshy that they quite commonly take special pains to <i class="calibre4"> avoid</i> peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the loveshy often <i class="calibre4"> deliberately choose</i> a life of solitary confinement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the loveshys' prison is an internal, self-imposed one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">: But that observation only scratches the surface. In order for us to truly understand the loveshy we first need to comprehend why they found it necessary to erect their internal prisons (defensive walls) in the first</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 2 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">place. This is important, socially valuable knowledge. Armed with this knowledge it may become possible to engineer a kind of elementary school environment which inspires no child into building an insur-mountable wall around himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The peer group is of enormous importance from the standpoint of ensuring propitious growth and development. This appears to be especially true for males. There is evidence that the same-sexed peer group is of considerably less importance for females than it is for males. For example, women who are unpopular among their same-sexed peers often become highly popular with men. By contrast, males who are unpopular among members of their own sex <i class="calibre4"> virtually never</i> become popular or even mildly successful with women. The social requirement that males must be the ones to make the first move vis-a-vis the female gender may partially account for this. Males without a network of same-sexed friendships have nothing to support them in their natural strivings to become assertive in a positive, friendly way vis-a-vis potentially eligible female dating partners. Simply put, a reasonable level of success within the all-male peer group constitutes a prime prerequisite for a male's ability to attain even a very mild degree of success in securing female companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Key Importance for Dating of Friendship</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Networks</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past decade sociologists have published numerous research studies which have highlighted the importance of informal friendship networks. One of the key findings to emerge from this work is the fact that most Americans of both sexes initially meet their future marriage partners through their friends. Of course, popular folklore would have us believe that Cupid accomplishes most of his work in such public places as beaches, bars, discoteques, zoos, etc., and that employment situations and dating services also provide fertile soil for the sprouting of incipient romances. The reality of the situation is that women tend to be quite wary of strangers. The reality of the situation is that <i class="calibre4"> informal friendship networks</i> instigate far more male-female relationships that eventually lead to cohabitation and/or marriage than do all of these impersonal meeting grounds put together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This represents a social fact of the most profound sort for our understanding of the plight of loveshy men, and for our efforts to understand how they got to be loveshy in the first place. Even the best employment opportunities are obtained some 70 percent of the time</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>2 2 8 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the proper and effective use of informal social networks. Love and work, the two most indispensably crucial ingredients of life, are <i class="calibre4">both</i> a direct byproduct of how successful people are in cultivating highly satisfying, quality friendship networks. The more solid our friendship networks are, the more solid will be our satisfactions and rewards in <i class="calibre4">both</i> LOVE <i class="calibre4"> and</i> WORK.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A related fact is that it is actually easier to meet members of the opposite sex through friendship networks than through any other means.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It requires a significantly greater amount of courage and self-confidence to initiate a conversation with a total stranger than it does to initiate one with someone to whom one has been introduced by a <i class="calibre4"> mutual friend. </i> This is true for the vast majority of people, and it is certainly true for those with interpersonal anxiety or shyness problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, shyness above and beyond a certain point of severity prevents a person from ever immersing himself into any informal social networks. The real rub is that for those who actually enjoy active membership in informal social networks,  <i class="calibre4"> substantially less</i> social self-confidence and "nerve" is required for meeting potential lovers than is required for people who do not have membership in informal friendship networks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, more is actually required of the severely isolated, loveshy man, than is required of the moderately self-confident man who has a small network of friends. The former is <i class="calibre4"> forced</i> to deal with impersonal agencies and meeting places if he ever hopes to obtain a wife. The latter can totally avoid the hard, cold, impersonal world by depending upon his friendship networks.1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Harlow Research</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his work with Rhesus monkeys, University of Wisconsin researcher Harry Harlow found that animals deprived of play amid a peer group while growing up became, upon reaching maturity, totally incapable of reproducing on their own. In fact, this was found to be true even for animals that had <i class="calibre4"> not</i> been deprived of mother love. Peer group deprived female monkeys refused to permit even very socially successful males to mount them. These sexually disinterested females had to be impregnated by artificial insemination. Upon giving birth they tended to treat their young as though it were feces. They stomped on it, threw it against the cage wall, ignored it, and in some cases actually started eating it. The male monkeys that had been deprived of a peer group while growing up tended to sit in a corner and simply stare at the females. Harlow placed deprived males into enclosures with a large</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 2 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">number of normally sexually receptive females. Yet in spite of the favorable gender-ratio and lack of sexual competition, these males refused to make any efforts towards sexual mounting behavior. In fact, in most cases they didn't even make an effort to play with the females. In most cases they simply sat on the sidelines watching and staring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One thing which particularly struck me about Harlow's findings is that the "watching" and "staring" reaction of the deprived monkeys seems to be very commonplace among loveshy <i class="calibre4"> human</i> males. In essence, rather than risk making an approach, loveshy human males quite commonly just simply watch and stare and daydream. Moreover, this "staring" behavior seems to persist even in environments offering a favorable gender ratio. There can be six women to every man, and the loveshy male will still "watch and stare and daydream" in lieu of taking positive action.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Harlow was able to demonstrate in his work with monkeys, play and the multitudinous play-related experiences of childhood constitute a crucial and indispensable preparation for adult roles. And so it is with <i class="calibre4"> human</i> children. To the extent that a person had been deprived of a childhood incorporating a great deal of happy, carefree play with other children, to that extent he could be expected to come of age inadequately prepared to competently fulfill adult family and employment roles.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Polish Peasant</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">W. I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki, in their book THE POLISH</p>
<p class="calibre1">PEASANT IN AMERICA, cite many cases of boys who had been severely mistreated by their parents. Most of these impoverished Polish-American boys responded to such insensitive treatment by developing and maintaining a strong sense of solidarity with their male peers. Those who remained well integrated members of peer networks became effective, well adjusted adults, quite in spite of their past history of abuse at home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The few who lacked a friendship group to turn to in times of severe stress and unfair treatment, tended to become isolated and very poorly functioning adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas and Znaniecki's conclusions regarding human children are very similar to those arrived at by Harlow in his work with Rhesus monkeys. In essence, Harlow found that young monkeys could almost always be expected to survive ineffective mothering very well indeed if they had had the benefit of a regular peer group life with fellow young monkeys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a>2 3 0 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">As scores of social scientists have been able to demonstrate, children who do not experience a childhood become very poorly adjusted adults. A person's <i class="calibre4"> social</i> adjustment as an adult is directly related to his having been actively involved in social play as a child. Child's play is important, especially to the extent that it involves cooperative, friendly interaction with a network of age-mate peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At one point in the interviews I asked each respondent in my own study to react to the statement: "I guess I was never really a child." And the pattern of obtained results back up the traditional wisdom about the importance of childhood. More specifically,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident non-shys agreed with this statement. In contrast, fully 71</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 59 percent of the younger ones saw fit to agree with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bullying</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A key premise of this book is that loveshy males learn early in life to perceive peer interaction as painful. If this is indeed the case, socially avoidant behavior along with self-imposed social isolation becomes more easily understandable. Again, most people associate informal peer interaction with feelings of pleasure. How and why did the loveshy come to associate such interaction with pain? Let us begin our analysis with a look at the widespread social phenomenon of bullying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The male peer group among elementary school aged boys can be extremely cruel. The reasons as to why this is the case have been accorded far too little attention by research investigators. There are scores of societies all over the world wherein violence, cruelty and bullying (including psychological hazing) are totally absent phenomena as far as children's peer groups are concerned. In America these painful phenomena are far from absent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each of my respondents to react to the statement: "When I was a child I was often bullied by other children of my own age." It is important to note that <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> among the 200 non-shys indicated that this had been true for them. In stark contrast, fully 94 percent of the older loveshys together with 81 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that it had been true for them. In essence, better than four-fifths of even the younger (university sample) shy men had been frequently bullied while growing up. For the older loveshys almost all had been frequently bullied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the risk of redundancy, I would assert that the significance of this finding for understanding the development of loveshyness cannot be too greatly overemphasized. In chapter two I documented how</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 3 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshy men differ substantially from non-shys in terms of inborn, biologically and physiologically based temperament. Doubtless the physical and psychoemotional hazing interacted with these "weaker"</p>
<p class="calibre1">biologically based inborn temperaments in a synergistic kind of way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The net result of this was undoubtedly to enhance social avoidance tendencies. Because of low inborn anxiety and emotional sensitivity thresholds, the loveshy men studied for this book probably suffered far more psychoemotional pain and scars than a non-shy person would have suffered even if such a non-shy person had been the recipient of the same quantity of bullying and psychoemotional hazing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further point is that the <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> of running away and not defending oneself "like a man" is doubtless very negative in most American all-male peer groups of elementary and junior high school age. Simply put, if children are going to bully someone, they are far more likely to select a victim whose displeasure and suffering is conspicuous and clearly evident for all to see. It is endemic in the perversion of bullying for the perpetrators to single out those who clearly suffer most, and who are unwilling and unable to defend themselves. This is why the <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> concept is so important in understanding bullying and in understanding the evolution of loveshyness and of socially avoidant, self-isolation tendencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a similar question I asked each of my 500 respondents to react to the statement: "When I was a child I never fought back when I was punched." And here again, fully 94 percent of the older loveshy men agreed that this had indeed been the case for them. And among the younger loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent indicated that it had been the case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, only 18 percent of the non-shy men indicated that they had never fought back. And several of these men added that it had never been necessary for them to do so because no one had ever punched them in the first place!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Even at the senior high school level</i> the loveshy men studied for this book had received an incredibly large amount of bullying and psychoemotional harassment. For example, 62 percent of the older loveshys together with 48 percent of the younger ones had received quite a bit of bullying even in the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. This had been true for <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the 200 non-shy men whom I interviewed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Frailness of Body Build</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to having a sensitive inborn temperament, body build may have served as another key variable increasing the likelihood that the loveshys would be bullied. Simply put, a frail build represents</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>2 3 2 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">another element contributing to negative <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> here in American culture. Young boys are constantly being programmed by their parents and by the mass media to admire physical strength and daring, and to detest—and even punish—physical weakness and fearfulness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the biases in American all-male peer group culture which reward the strong and punish the weak, I asked each man to respond to the following: "Comparing yourself to other students of your size, weight, and sex when you were in high school, how physically strong or weak were you?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 66 percent or almost two-thirds of the older loveshys perceived themselves as having been physically weaker than most of their male contemporaries. Among the younger loveshys the analogous figure was 42 percent. In contrast, only 9 percent of the non-shys felt that they had been physically weaker than the majority of their contemporaries of the same size and weight. Indeed, on the other side of the ledger 55 percent of the non-shys believed that they had been <i class="calibre4"> stronger</i> than most of their contemporaries. Only 21 percent of the younger loveshys and just 4 percent of the older ones felt that they had been physically stronger than most of their contemporaries. The remaining men indicated that they had been "about equally as strong as most others."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inauspicious Introductions to the All-Male Peer</p>
<p class="calibre1">Group</p>
<p class="calibre1">First impressions can be lasting. Often they set the stage for a person's future orientations toward a particular person or situation. This would certainly appear to be the case as far as the all-male peer group is concerned. The following interview segment can be considered representative:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Before I started school I don't remember ever being lonely. I usually had companions, but they were usually girls. I didn't think anything of it actually. There was this one little girl I used to play with all the time when I was three and four years old. In fact, I guess I played with her until we were both about ready to start school. She was the same age as I was, and we enjoyed being together. But our mothers were beginning to get rather nervous that we should be with kids of our own sex. I know my mother was really nervous about my being with this girl all the time. So one day about a week before I was supposed to start kindergarten she takes me to this house a few blocks from where we lived. And I remember there were a lot of boys my age there. I remember they were running</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 3 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">around on the lawn, screaming at each other and knocking each other down. One of the kids had a football, and he threw it at me hard. I was just standing there with my mother, and I practically shit in my pants! She was pushing me to join in, and she was saying things like 'Doesn't that look like fun!' and 'Isn't that fun?' and 'Why don't you run after them and join in?' and 'See, Billy is here! Why don't you join him?'</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I was just five years old at the time. And I had never known fear before. But boy! I really felt fear watching these kids! In retrospect, I guess what really bothered me was this idea that what I was watching was supposed to be fun! Jesus! I mean I might just as well have been watching a pack of wild tigers at play! I mean it was like I was watching a totally different species of animal! That's how detached I felt. Even though I was only five I realized right then and there that I was a different breed of animal than these kids I was watching. And I didn't know how to convey to my mother that this stuff they were doing didn't look anything like what I believed to be fun! My mother started to get really angry that I didn't want to join in. And it took several of the other mothers there to convince her not to force me—that I wasn't ready.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I wasn't holding on to my mother's hand either. Even at that age I wasn't comfortable with my mother. I remember I reacted by backing farther and farther away from both my mother and the kids who were kicking each other and knocking one another down. I just wanted to go off by myself and find my girlfriend to play with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually I was looking forward to starting school because I thought the kids at school would play nicely—you know, games like hide-and-seek, and hopscotch, and other games I played with my girlfriend. When I finally did start school I realized the very opposite was true. And I became more and more envious of the girls with each passing day because I felt I belonged with them. They were doing the things I liked to do while every minute with the boys was like bloody hell." (20-year old loveshy man.) The foregoing can be considered quite representative of the early peer group experiences of loveshy men. American society expects boys to play with boys, and girls to play with girls. And it expects the two different gender-segregated peer groups to engage in entirely different constellations of play activities. It further expects children to pursue their "gender-appropriate" play activities with gusto and enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For boys especially, "rough and tumble" play is expected to be viewed as "fun".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem, of course, is rooted in the untenable assumption that children of a particular gender can and should be encouraged to fall into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>2 3 4 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">the same mold. Simply put, most parents and educators believe in forcing square pegs into round holes, and in standardizing human personality into two different categories: male and female. I believe that chronic loveshyness along with a lifetime of loneliness and social isolation constitute part of the price that is intrinsic in this traditional and unchallenged way of doing things.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, each of the 500 men studied for this research was asked to react to the following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was six or seven years old, just watching boys partake in</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rough and tumble" type play activities scared me to death; I resented any expectation that I try to join in; I wanted just one or two close friends who would play gently and with no chance of anyone getting knocked down or hurt in any way."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the older loveshy men, fully 79 percent indicated that the statement had been <i class="calibre4"> true</i> for themselves. Among the younger loveshy men the analogous figure was 67 percent. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> among the ranks of the self-confident non-shys felt that the statement had ever been in any way true for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I asked for reactions to the statement: "When I was a child in elementary school, being knocked down by one of my peers was one of my greatest fears." And here again, fully 87 percent of the older loveshy men indicated "yes, this was true". And among the younger loveshys, 73 percent similarly indicated that the statement had been true for them. In contrast, only 19 percent of the non-shys said that the statement held any truth for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the research data I obtained for this book strongly suggest that there is a strong and direct relationship between (1) extent of fear and apprehension upon first coming face-to-face in early childhood with an all-male peer group, and (2) degree or severity of loveshyness in adulthood. Some children take to the all-male peer group <i class="calibre4"> and</i> the "rough and tumble" almost immediately, as soon as they are introduced to it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For these fortunate souls it is a matter very much like that of introducing a duck to water. The all-male peer group together with the "rough and tumble" is their "natural" mileau. For other youngsters this mileau is foreign and unnatural. Because this latter group of youngsters represents nonconformity from the "mainstream" expected course, there is a tendency to "see" them as being "homosexual" or "sick" or "neurotic" or just plain negative and uncooperative. In most cases such "nonmascu-line" boys are none of these things! Homosexuality, for example, has to do with erotic and romantic directionality; it has nothing at all to do with recreational play interests and proclivities. And as for neuroticism, there is mounting evidence that society <i class="calibre4"> creates</i> neurotics as a result of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 3 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">its insistence that all people of a particular category (e.g.,  <i class="calibre4"> boys)</i> must fit into a certain interest and activity mold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that to the extent that we create <i class="calibre4"> options</i> for children—to the extent that we afford them <i class="calibre4"> a choice of more than just one type of peer</i> <i class="calibre4">group, </i> to that extent we are likely to begin observing a sharp dropping off in the incidence of incipient neuroticism, and probably in homosexuality as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think one further point may be in order pertinent to the above case interview segment. Throughout my years of conducting interviews for this book I observed that loveshy men appear to have unusually rich and detailed memories of their early and middle childhood years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, loveshy men are often able to recount in considerable detail incidents that had transpired long before they had even entered kindergarten.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast, non-shy men do not appear to have anywhere nearly such rich and detailed memories of early childhood events. Many of the non-shys had difficulty recalling events as recent as their junior high school days, much less events of early childhood. In essence, the unusually sharp and detailed memories of the loveshy may be due in part to their unusually high degree of introspectiveness. But more importantly, such detailed memories may simply reflect their very low inborn anxiety threshold. Again, Eysenck's work has shown that introverts and low anxiety threshold people tend to condition (learn) responses far more deeply, thoroughly, and intractably than more advantaged people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the fact of not forgetting early childhood memories might simply be a reflection of this tendency on the part of inhibited people to condition deeply and permanently. Indeed, it probably also reflects their inability to "shake off" bad memories.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Masculine Toys</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another manifestation of this "visitor to a strange world" feeling vis-a-vis male peers which I found to have been quite prevalent in the formative years of the loveshy, has to do with toy preferences. Traditional gender-role stereotypes prescribe that little boys ought to be interested in toy guns, pistols, trucks, footballs, baseball bats and gloves, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> And these same norms prescribe that little boys had better not feel attracted to dolls, figurines, miniature houses, doll house items, miniature animals, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> However, not all people who happened to have been born of the male sex naturally gravitate in the direction of these nor-rnatively prescribed stereotypes. One 19-year old loveshy man had this to say:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>2 3 6 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As far back as I can remember, I always found male toys and male activities to be painfully boring. When I was in kindergarten I can remember that the teacher used to prod me all the time to join the boys and play on the floor with the trucks and the orange crates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time I used to enjoy making cut-outs with different colored paper. And I enjoyed working with clay quite a lot. But all that was looked upon as being girl's stuff. I hated the thought of getting on all fours with the boys, not only because what they were doing was very boring to me, but also because I felt very uncomfortable about getting dirty."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And a 42-year old loveshy man offered this remark:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was eight or nine I remember my mother used to shoo me out of the house all the time to play with some boys who lived in our neighborhood. I can remember these kids running all over the place with these cap guns and bragging to each other about how expensive and special their own cap gun was. I was just bored stiff by this and by the stupid western movies that these kids enjoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I usually just went off on long walks by myself whenever my mother threw me outside. I remember I had to keep the toys I really liked hidden away in an attic crevace because both my parents would swear and cus at me when they saw me admiring my miniature animals. I also had a lot of miniature chests of drawers and miniature silverware and mops. And I liked to play with my model railroad a lot. But I always had to play with these things on the sly, like when my parents weren't home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember one time when I was about nine I really wanted a Charley McCarthy doll (ventriloquist doll) really badly, and I kept nagging my father to buy it for me. There were really a lot of nasty scenes at the dinner table about this because both my parents kept insisting that this was girl stuff, and that I should be interested in guns and baseball, not dolls. But I can't remember one single time throughout my years as a child when I was even the slightest bit attracted to these things. My father took me to five or six professional baseball and football games and I couldn't wait until it was all over. I might as well have been watching a bunch of spiders spin a web, for all the interest it held for me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man: "When you were a child between the ages of 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">and 12, did you <i class="calibre4"> prefer</i> girl-type toys to boy-type toys?" And 83 percent of the older loveshy men said "yes", along with 61 percent of the younger loveshys.  <i class="calibre4"> Nobody</i> among the 200 non-shy men indicated that they had ever preferred "girl-type" toys to "boy-type" toys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a follow-up question I asked: "When you were about 12-years old, did you ever play with such items as dolls, miniature furniture, plastic or glass figurines, etc.?" And 88 percent of the older loveshys</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 3 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">along with 74 percent of the younger ones indicated "yes". In contrast, <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> of the non-shy men indicated "yes".</p>
<p class="calibre1">These differences could not have been due to the presence of too many girls in the household. Again, 71 percent of the older loveshys and 59 percent of the younger ones had grown up without sisters. Only 14 percent of the non-shy men had grown up without a sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, there is no evidence that the loveshys' parents had wanted a daughter. In fact, all of the loveshy men (both the older ones and the younger ones) believed that their parents had gotten what they wanted in giving birth to a son. And, indeed, some of them had pressed pretty hard in trying to turn their sons into "real boys".</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was about 11 my dad bought me this punching bag which he set up in the basement. And I can remember he used to make me practice using it. It was really horrible because it was just so boring, and the damn thing was making my knuckles become red.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean he was really stupid because there was no way I could ever fight back against any of those bullies. I don't even believe in fighting. It's stupid!" (20-year old loveshy man.) <b class="calibre3">The Baseball, Basketball, and Football Syndrome</b> In American society the mere thought of "boy" conjures up images of "rough and tumble" competition and enthusiasm for the "big three"</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumvirate of contact sports—football, basketball, and baseball. So deeply imbedded are these three sports in our concept of masculinity that some young fathers actually go to the trouble of erecting basketball hoops as soon as they learn that their wives are pregnant with male fetuses! People expect the interest and attention of a "healthy" boy of any age to immediately perk up as soon as the very words "baseball" or "football" are mentioned. And people often react with amazement and surprise when these words do not arouse an enthusiastic response. Indeed, miniature and even full-sized footballs and baseballs are often given to boys as Christmas or birthday presents as early in life as age three!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of these often uncompromising expectations which per-vade our society, I asked each of the 500 men interviewed a collection of questions about his past attitudes <i class="calibre4"> during childhood</i> towards a variety of sports. For example, I asked: "When you were growing up, how much did you like to play football?" And not surprisingly,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys and only 7 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they had <i class="calibre4"> loved to play it. </i> In contrast, fully 73 percent or <i class="calibre4">almost three-quarters</i> of the non-shy men indicated that they had loved to play football.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>2 3 8 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> among the non-shys had ever "disliked"</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing football, whereas 89 percent of the younger loveshys and fully 100 percent of the older loveshys had <i class="calibre4"> disliked</i> the idea of playing it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding the idea of options, which had seldom been available to the men interviewed, I asked the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Picture yourself as a high school teenager. Supposing you were given a choice between playing a game of touch football and going bowling. Which would you have chosen?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 87 percent of the non-shys selected the touch football, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the older loveshys, and just 9 percent of the younger loveshys. In essence, 100 percent of the older loveshys and 91 percent of the younger ones selected bowling over touch football.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 13 percent of the self-confident non-shy men selected bowling over touch football.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I presented each person interviewed with the following scenario:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Supposing you were at an all day picnic as a 15-year old. Suppose one group composed only of boys your own age was going to play games such as football, baseball and basketball all day long. The other group would spend the day learning how to play golf and would be composed of 8 boys and 8 girls. Which group do you think you would have been more likely to have selected?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite interestingly, only 52 percent of the non-shy men selected the group playing baseball, basketball and football, over the coeducational group that was to learn how to play golf. All 100 percent of the older loveshy men along with 98 percent of the younger loveshys similarly selected the coeducational golf-learning option.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These findings suggest that many naturally assertive, "typical"</p>
<p class="calibre1">boys could easily find delight in more gentle pursuits such as golf. The fact that golf, like bowling, is a <i class="calibre4"> lifetime sport</i> that need never be given up represents a powerful argument in its favor. Inasmuch as the sport provides an opportunity for good outdoor exercise, there is no reason why it, along with a good many other non-contact sports, should not be taught to school children—as an option for those wanting nothing to do with baseball, basketball and football.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "National Pastime" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The so-called "national pastime" fared little better among the loveshys than did football. Only 4 percent of the older loveshys had had any enthusiasm at all for baseball as they were growing up. The younger</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group 239</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshys had been more open to the sport with 13 percent indicating that they had enjoyed it. Among the self-confident non-shys, on the other hand, fully 86 percent had loved to play baseball.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus I asked each man: "At the age of 15, suppose someone had given you a choice between tennis lessons and baseball lessons. Which would you have chosen?" And in spite of the burgeoning popularity and high status of tennis, fully 66 percent of the self-confident non-shys opted for the baseball. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys and only 5 percent of the younger loveshys opted for the baseball over the tennis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Part of the loveshys' aversion to baseball may have been due to a higher than average sensitivity to bright sunlight. Fully 64 percent of the older loveshys and 56 percent of the younger ones indicated that bright sunlight made them very uncomfortable. This was true for only 21 percent of the non-shy men. However, it seems likely that the major reasons for the unpopularity of baseball among the loveshys were (1) it is a very non-romantic sport that is always played in gender segregated settings; and (2) it is a "rough and tumble" sport with a high probability of physical injury and pain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, throughout their formative years the loveshys had wanted to play in <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> peer groups. And most of them felt extremely bitter about the fact that American society arranges things in such a way that coeducational play is seldom a permitted option for growing children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Basketball</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men tend to view basketball with almost as much trepidation as they view football and baseball. Several of the men I interviewed commented about the flailing hands and arms, and about the inordinate speed. Both of these conditions are intrinsic to the sport of basketball. Of course, the loveshys' big fear was that they could get an eye knocked out or severely injured. In fact, one man specifically commented that he might have become interested in basketball had the sport required all players to wear goggles protecting the eyes along with some other paraphernalia designed to protect the mouth and teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The speed factor was viewed as quite frightening by most of the loveshys because they did not have the coordination to handle it. Some of the loveshys claimed that they could run quite fast as, for example, in a 100 meter dash. But in basketball many maneuvers involving both team mates and opponents must be made while in the process of running. The extremely fast thinking and movement required along with the absence of coeducation in the sport rendered basketball very unattractive to most of the loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>2 4 0 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to indicate whether during his junior and senior years of high school he preferred basketball to volleyball, or vice versa. And fully 95 percent of the older loveshys together with 82</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they had preferred <i class="calibre4"> volleyball</i> to basketball. In stark contrast, only 27 percent of the non-shy men had preferred volleyball to basketball during their junior and senior years of high school.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "Left Out" Syndrome</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One loveshy man told me that when his elementary school teachers required him to go outside and play baseball the kids always assigned him to play the position of "left out". Now this individual had <i class="calibre4"> wanted</i> to play baseball at that time. As I have indicated, the vast majority of the loveshys wanted to have nothing to do with baseball, basketball, football, or any other non-coeducational "rough and tumble" contact sport.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, whether they wanted to be involved in these sports or not, a strong message was made crystal clear to the loveshys time and time again. And that message was: "Get the fuck out of here! We don't want you, shithead! You're not important! You're incompetent!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">This message had been pounded home to the loveshys repeatedly throughout their formative years, and irrespective of whether or not a physical education class had been involved. When a physical education class had been involved, the teacher invariably had to force the children to admit the loveshy pupil onto one of the two competing teams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "In physical education classes back in my earlier school days, I was usually the <i class="calibre4"> last</i> <i class="calibre4">person</i> to be selected for a team when the kids were drawing up sides."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 91 percent of the older loveshys together with 70 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that this had indeed been the case. In stark contrast, only 3 percent of the non-shys indicated that they had usually been the last person selected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After approximately one-third of the data to be collected for this book had been obtained, I added an additional item to the research questionnaire. In essence, I began asking each of my respondents to react to the statement: "In elementary school when the teacher required everyone to play baseball, the kids usually assigned me to play the position of 'left out'." Only 1 percent of the non-shys who had been presented with this statement saw fit to agree with it. In stark contrast, fully 86 percent of the older loveshys together with 62 percent of the younger ones agreed that they had indeed usually been assigned to play the role of "left out".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 4 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now virtually anyone can understand how this sort of experience repeated time and time again throughout the formative, impressionable years could and most probably would operate to drastically lower a child's self-esteem. But what may be less apparent to some readers is that this experience also teaches children to associate peer group <i class="calibre4"> (people)</i> sociability with negative feelings of displeasure, pain and anxiety. It teaches them to find greater pleasure in solitary pursuits than in sociable ones. Elementary education and physical education protagonists require participation in sports with the ostensible purpose of providing good exercise and cultivating the capacity for friendly sociability. Some educators strongly believe that team sports teach children how to get along with each other. However, the evidence is that shyness-prone boys are <i class="calibre4">made worse</i> rather than better off by the types of physical education and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gym" requirements that are imposed upon them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old cliche that "one man's meat is another man's poison" is nowhere more true than in the contemporary policy of requiring all boys to play at baseball, basketball and football. Simply put, if we are to prevent loveshyness as well as a host of other psychoemotional disorders, we must insist that educators and parents stop trying to force square pegs into round holes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is true that all children need exercise. But it is equally clear that they do not all require <i class="calibre4"> the same type</i> of exercise. Forcing all boys (just because they are boys) to partake in the same "rough and tumble"</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise is the fastest way of defeating the educator's purpose. Educators want children to grow to love exercise, and to find a great deal of pleasure in it. Yet as a consequence of the experiences forced on children, the more inhibited, sensitive boys learn early in life to despise physical exercise, and to <i class="calibre4"> avoid</i> it just like any other unpleasant phenomenon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in avoiding exercise they are <i class="calibre4"> also</i> avoiding the opportunities for the development of social self-confidence and interpersonal skills—</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities which are generously accorded boys who <i class="calibre4"> fit</i> the baseball-basketball-football-loving mold.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Most People Know What Is In Their Best Interests</b> Most loveshy men seem to know what would have been in their best interests. All children absolutely require a copious abundance of opportunities for socializing with peers. And these opportunities must be looked forward to by <i class="calibre4"> all. </i> Sociability must be associated with <i class="calibre4"> pleasure</i> and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> with anxiety, fear and pain. Sports participation at all ages throughout the formative years must be genuinely FRIENDLY and <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">HOSTILE.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>2 4 2 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before I review my suggestions for remedying the shyness-generating situations with which all boys in contemporary America are required to contend, let me first present some attitude data. I asked each respondent to react to the following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Requiring all boys to play touch football, baseball and basketball in physical education class provides an open invitation to all the bullies and rough necks to gang up on shy and retiring boys who are not interested in and do not desire to play at rough and tumble contact sports."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 27 percent of the non-shy men agreed with this statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that included many men who very much enjoyed contact sports, but who had long been fully cognizant of the counterproductive consequences which forced involvement in such activities holds for the withdrawn and noncompetitive child. On the other hand, a majority of the non-shy men had taken some pleasure in the overt psychoemotional suffering which these "rough and tumble" sports had caused their more</p>
<p class="calibre1">"tender-hearted" classmates. This is reflected in the fact that 80 percent of the non-shy men admitted that when they were school children they had at least occasionally bullied their more withdrawn and inhibited peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas only 27 percent of the non-shys agreed with the above statement, fully 95 percent of the older loveshys and 86 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with it. Simply put, most loveshy adults fully realize the deleterious impact that a certain type of required "physical education" activity had had upon them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I asked each man to respond to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ideally, every elementary school and junior high school ought to have its own miniature golf course, bowling alley, and ping pong tables for children of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> sexes who prefer to play at gentle sports while their more aggressive classmates play at the more aggressive contact sports and games."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here again, fully 100 percent of the older loveshys and 92 percent of the younger ones agreed with this statement. In contrast, only 43</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shy men agreed. And whereas 43 percent is certainly a much lower figure than 92 percent, it nevertheless suggests that as many as half the people in most local communities might be willing to support the above idea.</p>
<p class="calibre1">1 then asked each respondent to react to this telltale statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"During my childhood years, I am sure that I would have had many more friends if sports and games a great deal gentler than baseball, basketball and football had been more readily available to me."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 4 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 87 percent of the older loveshy men along with 76 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with this statement. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident non-shys saw fit to agree with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as a check for consistency and reliability, I asked each respondent to react to this very similar item:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"During my childhood years I am sure that I would have been much happier if sports and games a great deal gentler than baseball, basketball and football had been more readily available to me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And again there were huge differences in the amount of agreement between the non-shys and the loveshy men. Fully 78 percent of the older loveshys together with 65 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with this statement. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> nobody</i> among the ranks of the non-shy men saw fit to agree with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to round out the picture, each respondent also reacted to the following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My sense of self-confidence and my social skills would both be a great deal better today if sports substantially more gentle than baseball, basketball and football, had been more readily available to me when I was growing up."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 64 percent of the older loveshys together with 52 percent of the younger ones agreed with the statement.  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the non-shy men agreed with it. Of course, no one can be completely sure as to how his development might have proceeded had certain past experiences been different. We are dealing here with a form of speculation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, the differences between the three research groups were so strong and consistent on all of these items that it seems highly probable that a message is being conveyed here which deserves to be taken seriously by parents, educators, and community leaders.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Solution</p>
<p class="calibre1">We must put a stop to the multitudinous shyness-generating situations to which our male children are exposed every day throughout the entirety of their formative years. I believe that this can be accomplished without imposing any strain upon cramped school budgets, and without inconveniencing boys who truly prefer to select "rough and tumble" forms of play. All children should be expected to take an active part in some sports activities. But all children <i class="calibre4"> must be accorded a choice as</i> <i class="calibre4">to which sports activities they wish to involve themselves in. </i> The available choices for children of all age levels must be made sufficiently varied to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>2 4 4 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodate people of inhibited and melancholic temperament. School districts are already required by law to accommodate the blind, the deaf, and children of all intelligence levels who are slow in learning how to read. Similar accommodations must also be made for children who are exceptional in the extremely important area of <i class="calibre4"> native temperament. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">American education quite fallaciously assumes that making friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">"comes natural" to all children, and that relaxed, easy-going sociability is therefore something which need not be taught. For the naturally reserved, making friends and learning "small talk" does not "come natural". Just as slow readers are given a set of learning experiences that is different from that which is accorded the majority of children, a <i class="calibre4"> "different" </i> set of classroom experiences must similarly be developed for shy and withdrawn,  <i class="calibre4"> socially</i> handicapped children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards this end I believe that a recreation and physical education program that is in harmony with the psychoemotional needs of <i class="calibre4"> ALL</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">children represents one of the most promising means for the prevention of chronic and intractable loveshyness. Such a program of recreation and physical education <i class="calibre4"> must</i> incorporate three basic ingredients: (1) children must be permitted a <i class="calibre4"> choice</i> of activities; options other than</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rough and tumble" play <i class="calibre4"> must</i> be readily available; (2) coeducational sports and games must always be available for those children who want it; and (3) inhibited, melancholic, low anxiety threshold boys must <i class="calibre4"> never</i> be required to play among a group of children containing bullies or rugged, "rough and tumble" oriented individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This third point is of especial importance. For even if the game were tiddleywinks, if an inhibited boy were assigned to play along side a "rough and tumble" oriented boy, you can <i class="calibre4"> rest assured</i> that the inhibited boy would very soon be bullied, and would soon learn to withdraw from tiddleywinks! Boys of diametrically opposite native temperaments <i class="calibre4">must never</i> be made to play together. Lambs must never be made to play with lion cubs! Just as the mentally retarded are never educated in the same classroom as the intellectually gifted, the highly inhibited must <i class="calibre4">never</i> be thrown in with the highly exuberant, aggressive extrovert. This is true <i class="calibre4"> no matter what</i> sport or game might be involved.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding point  # 1 , I would suggest that the following can and should be made an integral part of the physical education curriculum of every elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school: (1) <i class="calibre4"> Bowling:</i> Schools need not construct their own bowling alleys—</p>
<p class="calibre1">although such construction might not be a bad idea if it can be afforded. School districts should rent an appropriate number of alleys from commercial establishments. Most bowling establishments are not particularly busy during the mornings</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 4 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">and early afternoons of the five weekdays. Interested children can easily be transported in coeducational groups to the bowling alleys during the various periods of the regular school day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) <i class="calibre4"> Ping Pong (Table Tennis):</i> Readers who have ever observed the Chinese play this on television know that there is far more <i class="calibre4">good exercise</i> to it than most people realize. All schools can easily obtain an appropriate number of ping pong tables. In essence, these facilities can be made available to children quite cheaply on all school premises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) <i class="calibre4"> Horseshoes:</i> This can easily and cheaply be made available in every school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) <i class="calibre4"> Miniature Golf:</i> This is a favorite of most inhibited boys. As with bowling alleys, miniature golf courses can be rented for the various periods of the regular school day. Financially well-off districts can build their own miniature golf courses. Often this can be done at low cost through the creation of summer work projects for young people. The help of art majors at various local colleges can also be sought in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(5) <i class="calibre4"> Golf:</i> Like #1 through #4, this is a <i class="calibre4"> life sport; </i> it is an activity that can be enjoyed throughout the life span. And it is one which can contribute to good physical (as well as mental and social) health throughout the life span. To be sure, few school districts will be able to afford their own golf courses. But such ownership is not necessary. Most schools have immediate access to a plain, grass-covered playground. This can be used to teach interested pupils the basic fundamentals of golf. A significant portion of a golf game can be played on a comparatively small sized playground. Of course, children can also be taken to regular, full-sized courses, after they have mastered the fundamentals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(6) <i class="calibre4"> Shuffle Board:</i> This is another gentle,  <i class="calibre4"> lifetime sport</i> that can easily and cheaply be made available on a coeducational basis in all school districts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(7) <i class="calibre4"> Croquet:</i> This is a gentle, lifetime sport that has long enjoyed considerable popularity in the United Kingdom. It would be very easy and inexpensive to make it available to all American school children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(8) <i class="calibre4"> Volleyball:</i> Most American schools already offer this. However, it needs to become a far more ubiquotous option than it currently is; and it needs to be made freely available on a strictly coeducational basis. Children with an aversion to baseball, basketball and football should always have volleyball available to them as an acceptable physical education option.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>2 4 6 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, volleyball can also be played in a swimming pool as well as in an indoor gymnasium, or outdoors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(9) <i class="calibre4"> Swimming:</i> Swimming is a <i class="calibre4"> lifetime sport</i> which requires the utilization of virtually all muscle systems. As such, it is a far better body builder than the far more aggressive sports of football, baseball and basketball! Many of our senior high schools already have swimming pools. Elementary schools seldom have them. But indoor swimming pools can be rented for use by school children. For example, children electing swimming as their sport might be required to join up with the YMCA—although this should be transformed into the "YPCA"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Young <i class="calibre4"> People's</i> Christian Association) thus ending sex-based segregation. Many motels also have indoor swimming pools which might be made available for rent to schools during certain portions of the weekdays. Time spent on Saturday mornings in swimming activities at the "Y" could be subtracted from any given child's required physical education time at school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(10) <i class="calibre4"> Billiards:</i> For quite irrational, often mysterious reasons, many people don't like the idea of children engaging in this activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet it provides good exercise, convivial companionship, and it can easily be played coeducationally. In addition, it is a <i class="calibre4">lifetime sport, </i> quite unlike the baseball, basketball and football that our society has so mindlessly and cruelly pushed upon all male children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(11) <i class="calibre4"> Frisbee Throwing: A</i> sport can easily be developed out of this popular activity. Fine exercise is provided by this activity; yet there is virtually no chance of physical injury and pain. Moreover, children who might be getting too little exercise might be shown how to engage in frisbee throwing (and catching) with their dogs. This is a quite enjoyable activity in which to involve one's canine companions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(12) <i class="calibre4"> Tennis:</i> I have found in my own work that many loveshy men are not afraid of the lifetime sport of tennis; although a small number of them commented that they would like to see comfortable eye-protectors devised for the sport. Even in our highly aggressive society, tennis has become a rather high status sport. Given the expressed interest in this sport by many loveshy men, it would appear especially appropriate to build tennis courts for those of our children who are temperamentally averse to "rough and tumble" activities. And tennis can be played "doubles" with two people on each "team". For</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 4 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">example, a boy and a girl can be pitted against another boy and girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(13) <i class="calibre4"> Racquetball:</i> This is another <i class="calibre4"> lifetime sport</i> which entails some of the same dangers to the eyes as does tennis. However, many loveshy men appear interested in this sport, and protective eyewear can surely be devised for it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(14) <i class="calibre4"> Horseback Riding:</i> Curiously, many loveshy men are far less afraid of animals, including horses, than they are of people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">School districts should construct small stables for the benefit of interested pupils. I recommend that only the "western saddle" be used. Teaching horseback riding with an "English saddle" is a good way to alienate most children from the sport.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(15) <i class="calibre4"> Tetherball:</i> This can be quite an aggressive game. Yet shy children like it because no matter how aggressive it becomes, there is virtually no chance of participants suffering any physical injury or pain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(16) <i class="calibre4"> Hopscotch:</i> This game provides fine exercise for all young children. And it is high time that we stopped restricting it to girls, or viewing it as a "girls only" activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(17) <i class="calibre4"> Bicycle Riding:</i> Inhibited children often do more of this than extroverted children do. Several of the loveshy men interviewed for this book had gone on 40 and 50 mile bicycle trips all by themselves, as young as age 11 or 12.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(18) <i class="calibre4"> Archery:</i> This can provide good exercise; and it also entails a competitive element.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(19) <i class="calibre4"> Ballroom and Social Dancing:</i> This can provide fine exercise, and it is an activity that is intrinsically coeducational. Moreover, it can be incorporated into an interpersonal skills education program. One note of caution, however: most loveshy men dislike any and all forms of rock music. They prefer waltzes, fox trots, tangos, love ballads, big band, jazz, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(20) <i class="calibre4"> Square Dancing:</i> This entails the same fine advantages as #19.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to being a good facilitator for heterosexual interaction, square dancing is also very good exercise. It teaches coordination and the ability to react rapidly to constantly changing cues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(21) <i class="calibre4"> jumping Rope:</i> Perhaps even more than hopscotch, this has traditionally been viewed as a "girl's activity". However, recently it has become a high energy sport that can be made quite demanding from the standpoint of endurance. Contrary to popular opinion, jumping rope can provide outstanding exercise; and can easily be done coeducationally.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>2 4 8 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">(22) <i class="calibre4"> Running:</i> Many loveshy males engage in quite a bit of this anyway—on their own. It provides good exercise and it can easily be done coeducationally. It can also be enjoyed as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"lead-in" to one of the other activities I have enumerated above.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key benefit of running for the loveshy is that it seems to enhance their rich fantasy life. And it is also a proven antidepressant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(23) <i class="calibre4"> Darts:</i> This is one of the most popular of gentle sports. Popular among both males and females on both sides of the Atlantic, involvement in it can easily serve as a catalyst promoting friendly, sociable interaction and conviviality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(24) <i class="calibre4"> Boccie:</i> This is an Italian variety of lawn bowling which is played on a small court. For those who insist that children must have <i class="calibre4">outdoor</i> exercise, this would represent a fine substitute for regular bowling. A nice, tree-shaded area should be used for constructing the courts.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of my critics have charged that the above twenty-four activities do not provide the competition that boys allegedly need to a greater extent than girls. Critics have also insisted that with the exception of volleyball these are not team sports; and that team sports are somehow necessary for teaching boys how to cooperate. The usual contention is that a cooperative spirit is picked up from active participation in baseball, basketball, and football; and that this cooperative and competitive spirit somehow transfers to the business world and to life in general.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would suggest that competitive drive is essentially a function of native temperament. Boys with an aggressive temperament are highly likely to gravitate naturally towards baseball, basketball and football.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they are similarly quite likely to display this aggressive drive vis-a-vis the business world. Simply put, it is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> competitive sports that <i class="calibre4">causes</i> competitive business drive. Every Sunday afternoon the bars are loaded with rather noncompetitive blue-collar men who have a great love of competitive sports. Instead,  <i class="calibre4"> active</i> participation in competitive sports <i class="calibre4"> AND active</i> competition in the business world <i class="calibre4"> both reflect</i> an inborn temperament that is fundamentally aggressive and characterized by a high anxiety threshold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As for cooperation, girls have long grown up without being required to partake in "rough and tumble" athletics. Yet it seems to me that females display far more of a cooperative spirit vis-a-vis each other than males typically do. Quite clearly, women do not enter adulthood less capable than men of cooperating effectively with others. The notion that participation in "rough and tumble" sports is a necessary condition for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 4 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspiring a spirit of cooperation and of friendly competition appears nothing short of ludicrous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the available research evidence has documented what is actually a far more important point. When shy and withdrawn boys are <i class="calibre4"> required</i> to participate in "rough and tumble" activities they withdraw into their private shells all the more completely. By encouraging shy and withdrawn boys to participate,  <i class="calibre4"> away from the company of bullies and</i> <i class="calibre4">other aggressive individuals, </i> in the twenty-four activities I have suggested (in lieu of rugged calesthenics and contact sports), the shy will be accorded the opportunity to (1) <i class="calibre4"> make friends, </i> and (2) to develop the interpersonal skills and social self-confidence that are crucial to success and happiness throughout life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, requiring loveshys to play football, baseball, basketball, <i class="calibre4">OR NOTHING, </i> results in their not being accorded the opportunity to cooperate or to informally associate WITH <i class="calibre4"> ANYONE. </i> Even those who are "gung ho" for contact sports and rugged calesthenics would have to agree that SOME LEARNING IS BETTER THAN NONE AT ALL; and that <i class="calibre4"> SOME</i> exercise is <i class="calibre4"> far better than none at all. </i> Except for running, swimming, and frisbee throwing,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the twenty-four activities I delineated require a partner. And if a person is too shy to have friends, it is a good bet that he will go through life without participating in <i class="calibre4"> any</i> sports activity. In essence, forcing square pegs into round holes always yields counterproductive outcomes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And baseball, basketball, football, and rugged calesthenics are not even <i class="calibre4"> lifetime sports. </i> In addition to not providing as much good exercise as swimming and running and several of the other activities delineated above, "rough and tumble" activities cannot even be practiced to any major extent by most people beyond the late 20s.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, options need to be made available to all school children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, highly active boys must be accorded their opportunities for participating in "rough and tumble" sports. But while they are "doing their thing", the less energetic and more socially withdrawn boys must similarly be accorded the dignity and respect as human beings to "do <i class="calibre4">their</i> thing" as well. While the assertive, aggressive boys happily pursue their football, the more withdrawn boys must have the right to run off and pursue their volleyball and bowling and miniature golf and swimming, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> AND THEY MUST HAVE A RIGHT TO ENJOY THESE</p>
<p class="calibre1">ACTIVITIES WITH GIRLS IN A <i class="calibre4"> COEDUCATIONAL</i> SETTING.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, socially withdrawn boys typically feel out of place in gender-segregated contexts. And whenever they are placed in such contexts they immediately fantasize about being with girls anyway. Lacking sisters as many of them do, they desperately need to learn how to interact</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>2 5 0 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortably with girls and to engage in mutually enjoyable small talk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, it is best that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of their required physical education activities be engaged in on a strictly coeducational basis. Such a background of coeducation may accord them the head start they need over their more fortunate male peers—a head start from the standpoint of feeling at home with and comfortable about associating informally with girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Physical education enthusiasts typically display a trained incapacity for perceiving their discipline in its proper perspective. To be sure, physical education is important. But it can eventuate in positive outcomes for children only to the extent that it (1) operates to enhance social self-confidence, and (2) inspires in children a deep seated need to pursue sports on their own throughout their life spans. To the extent that physical education <i class="calibre4"> blocks</i> the development of social self-confidence, to that extent it <i class="calibre4"> creates social isolates</i> who will lack both the nerve and the impetus for pursuing a lifelong program of enjoyable physical activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A person <i class="calibre4"> must</i> have meaningful friends in order to become emotionally "psyched up" for physical activity. Almost all sports including even the gentle ones require at least one partner. In order to have a partner one must first have a friend. And in order to sustain a friendship one must have a certain minimum of social self-confidence; one must feel reasonably good about oneself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of my respondents intuitively realized the truth behind these points. For example, I asked each respondent to react to the statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Social skills are more important to happiness as well as to mental and physical health than physical skills and physical fitness are." And 100</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of both the older and the younger loveshy men agreed. In fact, even among the self-confident non-shy men fully 59 percent registered agreement. As I have indicated, many different researchers have found <i class="calibre4">friendships</i> to be the <i class="calibre4"> number one</i> correlate of personal happiness and mental health. And as a deterioration in mental health is almost always accompanied by a deterioration in physical health, it is clear that the importance of meaningful friendships is far more pervasive than most people realize.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each of my respondents to react to this statement: "It is more important for a child to be socially well skilled with many friends than it is for him to be physically fit and good at sports." To be sure, in a society such as ours it is virtually impossible to even conceive of a child who is good at sports and who is not at the same time "socially well skilled with many friends." Nevertheless, I thought it might prove interesting to check out the opinions of the respondents relative to this hypothetical situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the older loveshys fully 100 percent agreed with the statement; and 97 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. The level of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 5 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement among the self-confident non-shys was 79 percent. This quite high level of agreement among the non-shys is particularly interesting given their somewhat lower level of agreement with the earlier statement that social skills are more important to happiness than physical fitness is; only 59 percent of the non-shys agreed with that, compared to 100</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the two loveshy groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, it is crucial that each child becomes a fully accepted and respected member of a peer group.  <i class="calibre4"> Nothing</i> is more important than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boys who are not psychoemotionally suited to "rough and tumble" play <i class="calibre4">MUST NEVER</i> be denied a peer group. We must be constantly on guard against overzealous football lovers who would deny meaningful friendships (and the crucial socialization that these provide) to more gentle-hearted boys. By providing children with a choice among a range of attractive sports, we are simultaneously according them a choice among a range of different kinds of peer groups. In this way each child can more easily find and keep friends who have native temperaments similar to his own. And in this way boys who are likely to be best off in <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> peer groups will be able to get their needs appropriately met.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, a gentle, introspective boy of <i class="calibre4"> any</i> age should be free to sustain close friendships with members of BOTH sexes. And he should be able to do this with the full support of his elementary school and junior high school educators.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Use of School Letters</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For many decades now American society has lavishly rewarded teenagers who perform well at football, baseball and basketball. This lavish praise is well symbolized in the so-called "school letters" that are awarded annually to the high school stars of these sports. It seems to me that a significant component of any program geared to the prevention of intractable shyness is going to have to include <i class="calibre4"> greatly expanding</i> the range of activities for which competent teenagers are awarded school letters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For openers I would suggest that every high school throughout the land should award letters for excellence in (1) bowling, (2) volleyball, (3) ping pong, (4) billiards, (5) miniature golf, (6) swimming, (7) shuffle board, (8) tennis, and <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the other <i class="calibre4"> gentle</i> sports that I delineated earlier. Indeed, letters might also be awarded to the high school champions of such nonathletic games as chess and bridge, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> To be sure, outstanding performance in the contact sports would not be ignored.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea would be to award one school letter to the most accomplished individual in each activity each year. Indeed, this might also be done</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>2 5 2 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">for each one of the three senior high school classes: sophomore, junior, and senior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recognition in the form of school letters should also be accorded the best pupil in each one of the academic disciplines as well. For example, each year each high school might award three mathematics letters: one to the best sophomore, one to the best junior, and one to the best senior. This would apply to <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the acadmic disciplines. This is not to be done merely because cultivation of the intellect is the traditional</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"raison d'etre" </i> of the high school. That would <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be sufficient reason as there are hundreds of thousands of extremely unhappy and ineffective intellectuals. The <i class="calibre4"> key reason</i> for these awards is that the greater their number (and the greater the diversity of competencies for which they are awarded), the more young people will be accorded the recognition and respect that they need to grow and flourish emotionally and to come to feel good about themselves. All human beings require recognition and respect; these things must <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be limited to those who are effective on the football gridiron and basketball court!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, I believe that awards need to be granted for those who go out for dramatics, theatre arts and singing. Most loveshy males are strongly interested in these areas. In fact, most loveshys appear unusually well-versed on subjects pertinent to the arts. Of course, their shyness had long served as a barrier preventing them from being anything more than a passive spectator at theatrical events. And I think this points to the necessity for engineering strong catalysts that would effectively enlist the active participation of the loveshy in artistic and theatrical activities. Dedicated teachers and educational administrators are needed who would gently press the loveshy towards regular and active participation in areas of their interest. Such gentle, "benevolent coercion" might also be effectively employed to involve shys in coeducational programs that might develop in them an above average competency in such areas as trumpet playing, clarinet, piano, solo singing, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that strong but gentle catalysts may be required to motivate the shy is well reflected in the pattern of responses to this questionnaire statement: "After I was 13 or so I usually tried not to sing out loud whenever anyone was around." Only 20 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed with this statement, compared to 100 percent of the older loveshys and 83 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Football: Should It Be Made Illegal? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important lessons I learned from the research I conducted for this book is that <i class="calibre4"> bullying costs. A</i> majority of the loveshys studied for this book had been heavily bullied by their age-mates</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group 253</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout their formative years. And I have no doubt that this history of almost incessant verbal and physical assault represents a major factor underlying the intractable loveshyness and social isolation from which they suffer today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is my belief that football both teaches and encourages bullying behavior vis-a-vis the weak and vis-a-vis children who are disinclined towards physical aggression. Unlike the thousands of hours of violent television programs which male children customarily watch, football is <i class="calibre4">NOT</i> a fantasy. FOOTBALL IS REALITY, and children know it. Moreover, young boys are clearly taught from the most tender ages onward that individuals who perform creditably at this violent sport are likely to be handsomely rewarded from the standpoint of money, recognition, popularity, attractive women, and everything else that makes life worthwhile. Simply put, young boys are taught to model their behavior after that of competent football stars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exacerbating the situation is the fact that a sizable minority of fathers strongly and sometimes coercively encourage their young sons to take part in "little league football" and to "kill" each other in order to move the football. CBS news magazine "60 MINUTES" ran several segments during recent years in which fathers were shown screaming at their sons <i class="calibre4"> to hit hard. </i> Indeed, the boys were shouted down quite harshly by their fathers if they were not observed as being sufficiently aggressive and rough. Some of these fathers may have been using their sons to "live out" in a vicarious way their own frustrated fantasies. But whatever psychodynamic may have been involved, this is clearly not a healthy situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This overzealous football mentality can easily be seen as <i class="calibre4"> encouraging</i> young boys to be (1) physically cruel vis-a-vis each other, and (2) as encouraging them not to feel any sense of guilt or remorse in striking out mindlessly and needlessly at one another. People do not talk to one another, or learn anything about one another's needs, feelings and emotions. People who are respected as <i class="calibre4"> "he men" </i> simply gang up and physically punch out, assault and tackle their imagined opponents. They are not supposed to care <i class="calibre4"> or even think</i> about human feelings, motives, intellect, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> They are not supposed to be either intellectually or emotionally oriented; and they are not supposed to be verbal. Mindless physical aggression and nerve are rewarded to a far greater extent than intelligence and benvolent compassion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In recent years I have aroused quite a bit of controversy at some of my lectures by suggesting that football ought to be made an illegal sport. It is quite interesting that the incidence of violent crime in American society over the years has directly paralleled the burgeoning interest in professional and university football. As televised football has reached</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>2 5 4 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">more and more young men, violent crime has burgeoned. Moreover, the popularity of football constitutes a far better barometer of this than the phenomenon of fictionalized violence on television. American television has always had a surfeit of violent westerns and crime programs—</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever since the days when Americans first began purchasing television sets in large numbers—back in the late 1940s. In contrast, it has only been since the early 1960s that the popularity of televised football has burgeoned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For those with the "right" native temperament, football enthusiasm is quite contagious. And thousands of male physical education instruc-tors and overzealous fathers have caught it. In their mindless enthusiasm these people have automatically assumed that (1) football is good for all boys, and that (2) if a child had been born a boy it is "only natural" for that boy to want to spend as much time and energy as he can developing football playing skills.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This "football consciousness" has permeated male peer groups at all age levels, as well as the various Cub Scout, Boy Scout, summer camp, and YMCA groups. And it has resulted in the continuing whole-sale rejection of the more sensitive, introspective boys who do not wish to pursue this or any similar "rough and tumble" recreational interests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many sensitive boys are fortunate enough to have supportive parents and relatives who help them to (1) group together with boys <i class="calibre4"> and girls</i> of similar disposition, and who (2) introduce them to more appropriate recreational and artistic interests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, a large number of introspective, introverted boys are less fortunate. Their parents disparage them for being "different". And the teachers at their schools ignore them and thereby deprive them of needed opportunities for earning the recognition and respect that all human beings require for propitious psychoemotional growth and development. Some of these boys are even labeled "queer" or "fag" or "homosexual" or "fairy nice boy" simply because they do not enjoy participating in "rough and tumble" endeavors—as though that had anything at all to do with sexual and romantic directionality—which it <i class="calibre4"> does not. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is far too much emphasis upon conformity in contemporary American society. And if we are ever to succeed in preventing intractable, chronic shyness we absolutely <i class="calibre4"> MUST</i> increase the range of fully respectable alternatives for people. Every person is born with a set of purposes to fulfill; and these purposes are directly related to inborn temperament. There is no rational reason why all male children must be pressed into engaging in "rough and tumble" forms of play. And there is no reason why they must all be pressed into playing in gender segregated peer groups. Further, there is no reason why they should all be constrained to like the same forms of music. It is interesting that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 5 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">record albums containing love ballads (sung by quality male voices) and Broadway show tunes have become very difficult to find in record stores during recent years. As with football, everyone is being shunted towards the "rock" music mold—a mold which simply does not fit all children and young adults. As a result, thousands of children and young people are getting needlessly "left out".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As of January 1983, pressure was beginning to mount for making boxing illegal. For about a century now, children who grew up in impoverished ghetto neighborhoods had often been railroaded and intimidated into involving themselves in boxing competition, just as middle-class children continue to be railroaded and intimidated into taking part in football. The intimidating pressures impacting upon children to participate in football have quite clearly affected a great many more millions of children than pressures to partake in boxing competition. And many hundreds of thousands more have been injured in football than in boxing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have no doubt that boxing too should be made illegal. However, football has long had a far more disasterous impact upon our society than boxing has had. Football involves many millions more people. And the insensitive, mindless pressures upon our children to take part in it continue to be far stronger than the pressures to take part in the two-opponent sport of boxing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Educators often speak of permitting only "touch" football at their schools. However, anyone who has made any observations at schools where intramural football is played fully realizes that "touch" is a grandiose euphamism of the most ludicrous and destructive sort. Boys with the aggressive native temperament appropos to football <i class="calibre4"> invariably</i> become so keyed up by the excitement of their sport that they <i class="calibre4"> invariably</i> knock down their opponents quite irrespective of what their gym teachers say about using "touch" only. The football model as consistently conveyed on television <i class="calibre4"> encourages</i> violence and insensitivity to the feelings and emotions of other male age-mates. And I believe that this violence-prone insensitivity often transfers (for at least some boys) into violence against the community as manifested in acts of vandalism, assault, mindless drinking binges, drunk driving, and other forms of violent crime and uncompassionate disrespect. Football teaches that it is "okey" to use power and coercion to control others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of the billions of dollars that are involved, football is not likely to be rendered illegal soon. It may require the passing of several centuries before our society evolves to the point where compassion will obviate cruelty, bullying and violence. Once that point is reached football will no longer be with us. In the meantime, there is much that we can do to protect our children from the crass, mindless enthusiasm that is endemic in football and in several other contact sports.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>256 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">The repeated witnessing of violent acts on television has been found by numerous scholars to render young boys significantly more violence prone vis-a-vis their male peers than they otherwise would be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has also been found to render them significantly less sensitive to and compassionate about the pain and suffering of their fellow human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, violence in sports (or in crime programs) creates a detached attitude with regard to human feelings and emotions that is very dangerous as well as dehumanizing. And since violence in sports is a reality and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> a fantasy, it is bound to have a stronger impact than fictionalized programs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, FOOTBALL BOTH INSPIRES AND ENCOURAGES <i class="calibre4"> BULLYING</i> and related uncompassionate attitudes, values and behaviors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As such I believe that football and other violent contact sports constitute a serious liability for our culture. And I believe that we will all be better off on the day when such activities disappear from our midst for good.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Current Peer Group Interaction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time they were interviewed virtually none of the 300 loveshy men studied for this book were involved with any significant friendships. A small number of them carried on a semi-active letter writing correspondence with "pen pals" located in distant parts of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And some of them were occasionally invited by co-workers to attend informal get-togethers. However, none of the loveshys with whom I talked had anyone <i class="calibre4"> of either gender</i> who they could feel free about spontaneously contacting for informal conversation or for mutual visitation, for going out to a movie or a restaurant, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In short, none of these men were integrated into any kind of an informal friendship network.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of these men possessed surprisingly good insight into how during their formative years they had learned to associate peer interaction with pain and humiliation. In fact, many of them were too introspective about their pasts. Not having any friends to distract them, many of these men would typically spend a great deal of time each day brooding about the past and the influence that it might have had upon them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Often such brooding would be interrupted only by their listening to their stereos or by their watching television. Most of the private thought and introspection activities of the loveshys (apart from their daydreams about being with a girl) revolved around either (1) their painful pasts and the impact that past experiences might have had upon their ability to secure female companionship, and (2) intellectual topics often pertaining to such matters as music, entertainment, the arts, theatre trivia,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 5 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychological subjects, and subjects pertinent to psychic phenomena and the occult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there appear to be some other important factors serving to keep most of the loveshys from even wanting male friendships. Most of the loveshys quite frankly indicated that <i class="calibre4"> even if they could get it</i> they preferred loneliness over the idea of having male friendships. Of course, since they did not want male companionship, there were no feelings of deprivation, yearning, or hurt preoccupation concerning its lack.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Discrepancy Between the Actual Self and the Ideal Self</i> Simply put, the idea of having a girlfriend was central to both the value systems and the emotional essence of each and every loveshy man studied for this book. In order for a person to appear genuine, to converse spontaneously and in a completely free manner without any sham or pretense, that person's lifestyle must bear at least some degree of congruency with the things that he thinks about all the time, his values, the things that matter to him and are important to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In male/male friendships, just as in female/female friendships, people "open up" most freely and frequently about the subjects that are most important to them. And they specifically gravitate towards just those same-sexed friends whose values, interests and preoccupations are essentially the same as their own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have already made clear, romantic male/female interaction occupied as much as 90 percent of the loveshys' daydream content. In essence, heterosexual interaction is enormously important to loveshy men. And for this reason, in order for them to converse on a truly open and spontaneous basis they would necessarily have to find male friends whose interests and values are the same as their own. In essence, they would have to find male friends who are similarly very interested in male/female interaction and who are themselves actually involved in a great deal of informal heterosexual interaction. Of course, the rub is that such a socially successful man would be highly unlikely to be interested in helping or even in interacting with someone who has seldom or never dated. The ideal for the loveshy would be male friends who would somehow take them (the loveshy) by the hands (figuratively speaking) and directly involve them in the sorts of heterosexual-romantic interaction about which they dream.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, in order for loveshy males to begin having meaningful <i class="calibre4"> male</i> friendships,  <i class="calibre4"> they must first solve their loveshyness problems</i> as far as <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> interaction is concerned. In order for a loveshy man to have and to keep a male friend,  <i class="calibre4"> he must first be actively involved in a romantic</i> <i class="calibre4">love relationship with a woman. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>2 5 8 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the interview material I obtained from the loveshys provides some very useful insights in this regard. Please consider the following quotations:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I've given a lot of thought to the idea of male friendships. I suppose it would be nice. I mean, it might help me. See, if I were going with someone (a girl) it would be just so damned much easier for me to have male friends. I'd have something to talk about with them. But right now, what the hell would I talk about with a male friend? I mean, everything I think about concerns woman! And I haven't got one! If I ever found a male friend who was anything like me, it would make me even more depressed because he wouldn't be able to help me. The guys I would really like to have as friends—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean the guys who are engaged or going with someone—well, they're not interested in having me as a friend. Like at work, some of those guys think I'm a homo. They don't think I have anything in common with them—which is ridiculous because I bet I do a lot more thinking and dreaming about women than any of them do!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(24-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"This may sound stupid. But I don't feel as though I'm the real me!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like I sometimes feel totally detached from the person I am because the person I am is not able to do the things that are really important to the real me. It's like the person that I am manifesting behaviorally is a total stranger to the real me, the me that includes the things in life that are really important to me. I have no control over the person I'm presenting to the world because my anxieties prevent me from doing the things I would really like to do. If I had any male friends how would I be able to maintain a straight face with them? I mean, what I would want to talk about with them and how I actually behave in real life are two drastically different things. I'd be seen as a hypocrite. The type of male friend I'd like to have would be bored with me because I wouldn't have anything to offer him. I wouldn't even have the nerve to confess my extremely strong desire to have a woman to love." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, how can the loveshys be expected to develop <i class="calibre4">male</i> friendships when all they ever think about is women and their deprivation of same?! There can be no doubt that all the painful hazing and bullying and forced involvement in baseball, basketball and football which plagued the loveshys in the past continues to have a bearing upon alienating them from the idea of male-to-male interaction in the present. But even if the loveshys could discipline their minds to forget their pasts, they would still have to deal with the problem of having a personality/temperament that is at drastic variance with their most deeply cherished values, interests, and secret goals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the loveshys <i class="calibre4"> could</i> grit their teeth and <i class="calibre4"> change</i> their values, interests, goals, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> But it is seldom realistic to ask a person to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 5 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">do such a thing. To change deeply held values and interests is usually tantamount to <i class="calibre4"> giving up one's whole sense of personal identity</i> and ego-structure. Values and interests represent the only grip on reality some of the loveshy men have. For them to give these up (very central components of the personal ego) could very easily threaten sanity itself.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications for Therapy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">After a loveshy man has been successfully helped to the point where he is involved in a stable heterosexual love relationship, I think it makes very good sense for his therapist to help him develop a friendship network. At that point in time the loveshy man will almost always be quite receptive towards the idea of developing male friendships. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> before</i> that time he will usually <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be receptive. Practice-dating therapy groups (discussed in <i class="calibre4"> section three</i> of this book) can prove very helpful catalysts in helping the loveshy to develop same-sexed friendship networks and mutual support systems. And their usefulness should be capitalized upon in that regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In recent years a controversy has developed among therapists working with the lonely and the loveshy. Many such therapists believe that the almost constant preoccupation loveshy men have with finding someone to love should be discouraged. Karen Rook and Letitia Peplau of the U.C.L.A. Loneliness Clinic have taken a rather crass and arrogant stance in this regard:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"While lonely individuals are most likely to say that they need 'one special person' or 'a romantic partner', their views do not necessarily represent psychologically sound treatment goals  . . . . Having such relationships does not necessarily protect one against feeling lonely, particularly when important social exchanges are not provided through the relationship  . . . . We recommend caution in defining relationship formation as <i class="calibre4"> the</i> goal of intervention with lonely clients</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . . Among the sociocultural factors that we suspect contribute to loneliness are the social stigma associated with being unmarried, and the cultural preoccupation with love relationships. We would call for greater acceptance of lifestyles other than traditional marriage. We urge that the pressure to 'achieve' love relationships be relaxed and that other forms of social relationships, particularly friendships, be given greater status." (Rook and Peplau, 1982, pp. 360-373.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been my experience that the only people <i class="calibre4"> preoccupied</i> to any extent at all with love relationships are those <i class="calibre4"> without</i> such relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Felt deprivation gives rise to preoccupation. </i> And the <i class="calibre4"> only workable way</i> to stem this preoccupation is to somehow satisfy the unmet need. To be sure, there are certain groups, such as elderly widows, for whom the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>2 6 0 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">obtaining of a heterosexual love relationship may indeed be unrealistic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a society with six times as many widows as widowers, sex ratio considerations alone dictate for some that ways other than heterosexual love and romance be cultivated for assuaging loneliness problems. On the other hand, in the case of the loveshy man there is no logical or necessary reason for a therapist to discourage his/her client from wanting a heterosexual love relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually, it would probably not even be feasible for a therapist to do this even if it were indicated. Loveshy men are too intensely preoccupied with their need for a female. It is <i class="calibre4"> only</i> through releasing this need and preoccupation <i class="calibre4"> through satisfying it</i> that the loveshy man can begin to appreciate the desirability of building up a network of meaningful, non-romantic friendships. This represents a key reason why the deep-seated emotional need for a love relationship MUST be satisfied <i class="calibre4"> first</i> before any other worthwhile goals can be worked on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, the having and sustaining of male friendships absolutely requires a reasonable degree of harmony between a man's ideal self (deeply held values, interests), and his real or actual self. A real self that is at drastic variance from the ideal or aspired to self <i class="calibre4"> effectively blocks</i> <i class="calibre4">spontaneous, free-flowing communication. </i> In addition, it makes the loveshy man appear bored and disinterested in what the other members of the all-male friendship network are conversing about. It makes the loveshy man appear excessively self-centered and self-preoccupied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A person's own cup must be reasonably full before he is going to be in any position to share the content of his cup with other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Until a loveshy man has made substantial progress towards the attaining of meaningful female companionship, his "cup" is going to be well nigh empty. He is certainly not going to be in a position to freely and unself-consciously <i class="calibre4"> share</i> anything of his "cup" with <i class="calibre4"> male</i> friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And why should "friendships" have to be of only one sex (one's own sex) anyway! Like many therapists, Rook and Peplau assume that friendship and social support networks must necessarily be comprised of people of just one gender. This represents a very deeply ingrained cultural assumption and bias which (1) is very destructive, and (2) which we need to get away from. This is a key reason why I have stressed throughout this book the desirability of developing a Coed Scouts organization for children—so that those who wish to do so can learn to play and to comfortably interact in strictly coeducational settings from the earliest ages in life onward. Neither children nor adults should have to accept strictly sex-segregated friendship groups. More succinctly, there is no reason why a man (or boy) cannot have a woman (girl) as a lover and/or wife, and other women (girls) as <i class="calibre4"> "just good friends". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In general, it is both arrogant and alienating for a therapist to intimate to his/her loveshy client that he/she knows what his/her client</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 6 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs better than his/her loveshy client himself knows what he needs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is this very arrogance that led most of the older loveshy men to a firm resolve to never again seek out a clinical psychologist or any other type of professional psychotherapeutic counselor. Simply put, I believe that therapists have a moral obligation to honor their client's presenting problem, felt needs and preoccupation. A person almost always knows (1) what he needs, and (2) what is truly in his best interests, far better than anyone else ever could. The rightful and proper task of a shyness therapist is to help his loveshy client obtain and develop an emotionally satisfying relationship with a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"Society's Goal" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Therapists such as Rook and Peplau speak as though the goal of finding a lover is actually not the loveshy man's goal at all, but merely just <i class="calibre4"> society's goal</i> which the loveshy man had just mindlessly internalized through the ordinary processes of socialization. In essence, Rook and Peplau are arguing that loveshy men simply mirror and reflect the societal prescription that everyone ought to have an opposite-sexed lover.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem with this reasoning is that most of the loveshys had been extremely desirous of an opposite sexed lover ever since they had been small children in kindergarten or the first grade. In other words, these men had wanted the emotionally close and intimate companionship of a girl friend at a time when this desire had been highly antithetical to the mainstream American society's prescription as to what kindergarten and elementary school children <i class="calibre4"> ought to want. </i> Society tells kindergarten and elementary school children that they "ought to want" to play in strictly sex-segregated peer groups. It also tells them that boys</p>
<p class="calibre1">"ought to want" to play at "rough and tumble" sports. In fact, society even goes so far as to prescribe that elementary school boys "ought to"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">hate</i> age-mate girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men studied for this book had been quite refractory and resistant to these as well as to scores of other societal prescriptions as to how they "ought to" think, feel, behave, and want. The question naturally arises as to why these loveshy men should now as adults all of a sudden become desirous of following society's behavioral prescriptions!</p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, they have <i class="calibre4"> not</i> all of a sudden become so desirous!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' strong need for the love of an opposite sexed companion had been very much a part of their essence as human beings since their earliest ages. This intractable urge for a lover had long been their most deeply cherished goal. For loveshy men such a goal is obviously <i class="calibre4"> not</i> a mere reflection of society's prescription that everyone ought to be mated!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>2 6 2 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Friendship Networks and Happy Marriages</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the happiest marriages tend to be those in which both the husband and the wife are actively involved in meaningful friendship networks. At least a dozen major research investigations have demonstrated this to be a fact. However, there are at least two ways a therapist can interpret this fact. The <i class="calibre4"> wrong way</i> would be for the therapist to work first toward the goal of getting the loveshy client to develop a friendship network. The <i class="calibre4"> right way</i> would be to <i class="calibre4"> first</i> get the loveshy man into a practice-dating therapy group for as much time as he may need to find and develop an emotionally satisfying heterosexual love relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, either <i class="calibre4"> concurrent</i> with practice-dating group therapy (if the client is receptive) or after it has been completed, help the client develop a network of meaningful non-romantic friendships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite all of their seeming dislike for members of their own gender, many of the loveshy men I talked with looked forward with considerable anticipation to what might best be described as <i class="calibre4"> "couples</i> <i class="calibre4">friendships". </i> In essence, the loveshys did not want to interact <i class="calibre4"> on their</i> <i class="calibre4">own</i> with an all-male peer group. But they did aspire to being able to entertain married couples, once they themselves become part of a married couple. They also looked forward to being able to go out <i class="calibre4"> as a married</i> <i class="calibre4">couple</i> to visit with other married couples.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshy men specifically felt that once they were married they would be able to meet and to interact with a great many interesting male friends—through their wife's efforts. But they wanted to do this exclusively as a couple,  <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> as a single. None of the loveshys with whom I spoke could see themselves as ever wanting to leave their wives and children at home in order to go out by themselves for purposes of socializing in a sex-segregated peer group. The loveshys tended to view such same-sexed interaction as being quite disparagingly juvenile. They entertained no desire to do it as a married adult; they did not want to do it presently as a single man; and they obviously had not wished to do it even when they had been children and teenagers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a curious paradox here. Many women might view this sort of "home and family oriented" husband as representing an "ideal catch"—</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost "too good to be true!" Surely such a man might well be far less prone towards infidelity than the more outgoing type of individual. And yet the severe shyness, inhibition and low anxiety threshold of this sort of man keeps him from being experienced by <i class="calibre4"> any</i> woman!</p>
<p class="calibre1">People need <i class="calibre4"> both</i> a network of friends <i class="calibre4"> and</i> an emotional love-attachment figure in order to be maximally happy and well adjusted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For most males the latter is definitely of far greater importance than the former. For most women the former may be of somewhat greater</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>LoveShyness and the All-Male Peer Group  2 6 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">importance than the latter. Again, there is a great deal of truth to the cliche that <i class="calibre4"> men need women a great deal more than women need men. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Notes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Membership in friendship networks also permits non-shy men to bypass problems created by the initial suspiciousness, fearfulness and hostility that many young women feel and display towards men whom they do not know. The burgeoning rate of violent crime committed by men against women has rendered women (particularly in the cities) more leery, hostile and suspicious of strangers than they have ever been before.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, men who can be introduced to women by mutual friends enjoy an especially strong advantage. Again, as severely loveshy men do not belong to any such friendship or kinship group networks, far more is expected and demanded of them than is the case for non-shy or for moderately (but not pathologically) shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. A very good case can be made for the proposition that loveshy heterosexuals ought not be expected to play <i class="calibre4"> at all</i> in the company of high energy aggressive extroverts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As of April 1985, the New York City school district opened up the nation's first high school for homosexuals and lesbians. A key <i class="calibre4"> raison d'etre</i> for doing this was that such children could not learn effectively in regular high schools with all the bullying to which they had been subjected. (High school name is: Harvey Milk High School.) 1 would suggest that <i class="calibre4"> inhibited, emotionally sensitive boys</i> (pre-love-shy heterosexuals) are up against essentially the <i class="calibre4"> same problem. </i> And as such, special <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> education facilities might well be expected to bring the best out of such temperamentally handicapped children. Under conditions of a strong self-esteem a person can far more readily contribute the most both to his own well-being as well as to that of his community.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. There is some evidence that excessively shy, inhibited boys have an excess of the brain chemical <i class="calibre4"> dopamine</i> (see Wender &amp; Klein, 1981, p. 220). Unless certain drugs are administered to neutralize some of this dopamine, very shy, withdrawn and fearful behavior is normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Even though it isn't considered a sport, one of the activities most thoroughly enjoyed by the loveshys as children was swinging on playground swings. Indeed, using the swings tended to be recalled by the loveshys as having been their favorite playground activity. In view of the fact that swinging does represent good exercise, it too could be made available to loveshy elementary and junior high school aged boys while their more aggressive peers play at their "rough and tumble" sports. Further, for those choosing it, swinging can be done on a strictly coeducational basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>
<a id="p296"></a>Chapter 11</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Powerful Impact of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Preadolescent Infatuations</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a very cruel and curious paradox in the psychoemotional development of loveshy men which deserves special attention. From the standpoint of <i class="calibre4"> overt behavior</i> any disinterested person would judge loveshy men to be (1) extremely "late starters", and (2) perhaps not especially interested in women at all. Most people tend to judge others by overtly manifested behavior. Indeed, most of us tend to view overt behavior as constituting a reasonably accurate barometer of a person's wishes, values, attitudes, feelings and aspirations. We tend to view such behavior as a good index as to what is actually going on inside of a person's head. And so it is perfectly understandable that most of us would view as "disinterested" any man in his late 30s or 40s who has seldom or never dated women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But as I have argued throughout this book, severe and chronic shyness blocks the normal exercising of free choice and self-determination.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy cannot allow their behavior to reflect their deepest wishes, desires, values, etc., because doing so would overcome them with severe feelings of anxiety. In fact, the mere thought of experiencing this anxiety is so painfully forbidding to the intractably loveshy person that he will not allow himself to even fantasize making plans to do the kinds of things he would love to do. To be sure, the loveshy man does spend a tremendous amount of time and energy fantasizing about being with a girl whom he can love. But these fantasies never extend to the practical business of <i class="calibre4"> engineering a viable plan</i> for actually winning the affections of a girl. The severely loveshy man cannot permit himself to engineer a plan to telephone a girl or start a conversation with one at work or school, or to ask a girl who is attractive to him for a lunch of a coffee date. He cannot calm himself sufficiently to do these things because the fear of the anxiety that would be created from merely thinking about doing them is far too much for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2 6 5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>2 6 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Paradox</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The paradox is that loveshy men become romantically interested in the opposite sex significantly earlier in life than do non-shy men. And the more severely loveshy a man is, the earlier in life he is likely to have become deeply interested in the other gender from a romantic/</p>
<p class="calibre1">esthetic standpoint. For example, 87 percent of the older loveshy men who were studied for this research indicated that <i class="calibre4"> prior to the age of 13,</i> <i class="calibre4">they had experienced feelings of loneliness for the close, emotionally meaningful</i> <i class="calibre4">companionship of an opposite-sexed age-mate. Similarly, 73 percent of the younger</i> <i class="calibre4">loveshys had experienced such feelings prior to their 13th birthday, whereas</i> <i class="calibre4">none</i> of the 200 self-confident non-shy men had ever experienced such feelings prior to their 13th birthday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the questionnaire statements to which each man reacted read as follows: "When I was a child of about 10 or 11, there was nothing I used to spend more time daydreaming about than little girls of my age or younger." Here again,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men responded in the affirmative. In stark contrast, fully 63 percent of the older loveshys together with 48 percent of the younger ones agreed that the statement had indeed been true for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In an effort to get down to specifics, I then asked each man: "What was your grade in school when you first felt a strong, romantic interest in an age-mate of the opposite sex?" The <i class="calibre4"> average</i> for the 100 older loveshy men was <i class="calibre4"> grade 2.13. </i> The average for the 200 younger loveshy men was <i class="calibre4"> grade 3.52. </i> And the <i class="calibre4"> average</i> for the 200 self-confident non-shy men was <i class="calibre4"> grade 6.43. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I also checked out the <i class="calibre4"> modes</i> (the most frequent response) for each of the three groups of men studied. And they were as follows: 34 percent of the older loveshys had first become romantically interested in a girl while in the <i class="calibre4"> first grade. </i> The mode for the younger loveshys was <i class="calibre4"> grade</i> <i class="calibre4">three:</i> 29 percent of them checked that. And the mode for the self-confident non-shys was <i class="calibre4"> grade nine; </i> 38 percent of the non-shy men had not become romantically interested in an opposite-sexed age-mate until they were in the ninth grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some readers may think that even a mean of <i class="calibre4"> grade 6.43</i> (the mean for the non-shys) is quite young. However, research over the years has clearly demonstrated that most middle-class children of both sexes first become romantically interested in the fourth, fifth or sixth grades. Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlfred Broderick of University of Southern California, has collected the most extensive amount of data on this subject. However, even in the 1890s most middle-class American boys seemed to have become romantically interested in opposite-sexed classmates by the time they were in the fifth or sixth grades. Writing in the 1902 volume of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 6 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY, Sanford Bell cited data (which he had obtained during the 1890s) which jibe very nicely with the far more recent data of Professor Broderick. Parenthetically, nine-teenth century novelist Samuel Clemens similarly seemed to have had a keen awareness of prepubescent love. As "Mark Twain" he created the celebrated Tom Sawyer/Becky Thatcher romance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people find this phenomenon difficult to understand because (1) they confuse sex with love, and (2) because they have forgotten their own early romantic interests. And for some reason adult women are a good deal more likely than adult men to forget and to make light of the strong romantic infatuations that they had experienced during their elementary school years. It seems quite probable that erotic sexuality does remain largely latent (at least in the industrialized world) throughout the elementary school age period. But romantic/esthetic needs are not the same as sexual needs. Romantic and esthetic needs seem to manifest themselves very early and very strongly in the lives of some children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, loveshy men quite typically experience many, many long years of intensely felt deprivation regarding the opposite sex. And this explains why so many of them tend to be so vastly more preoccupied <i class="calibre4">and obsessed with</i> thoughts about women, love, romance and sexuality, than the vast majority of men. Felt deprivation tends to give rise to preoccupation and obsession. And this psychological truism is no where better reflected than in the lives of loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The usual scenario in a male's development of heterosexual interests goes something like this: Between the sixth and the ninth grades he begins to show strong romantic interests in one or more girls in his classes. He occasionally talks with these girls and attends some parent-supervised parties with them. By the ninth or tenth grade he begins dating. This may be done on a group basis at the outset; but by the middle of his tenth grade year he begins dating on a one-on-one basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And by the eleventh grade he begins "going steady", although his early</p>
<p class="calibre1">"steady" relationships may not remain entirely exclusive over very much time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, most American males suffer some inhibitions and twinges of shyness when they first commence becoming romantically interested in a girl. The younger a boy is and the more beautiful the object of his infatuation is, the greater the likelihood that these twinges of shyness may create several weeks of emotionally painful distraction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During these weeks he is likely to be extremely affected by the girl's looks. And he is likely to remain too shy to start a conversation with her or to in any way endeavor to get to know her. It is during this period when the beautiful object of his affections will be the central figure of his daydreams and "wish-fulfillment fantasies.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>2 6 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Research has shown, however, that most American boys suffer these periods of emotionally painful distraction and preoccupation for just three or four weeks. For many of them these painful periods may last for a mere fortnight or less. A teenaged boy of normal emotional health and interpersonal skills may suffer through two or three of these periods between the time of his initial romantic infatuation (in the sixth grade) and the time when he actually marries—say at age 24 or there-about. So that by the time he gets to be 25 years old he will have had to deal with perhaps eight or nine weeks (total) of what a chronically loveshy male experiences at all times from the time he is seven years old until he is a very old man. The self-confident non-shy boy with plenty of male friends and a respected place in his peer group may never experience <i class="calibre4"> any</i> such periods in his life. The somewhat less fortunate but adequately confident young man may experience a maximum of eight or nine weeks of such "lovelorn" periods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the typical loveshy man commences an intense romantic preoccupation with the opposite sex when he is anywhere from kindergarten age to the second or third grade. This mental set remains intractably welded to him and intensely affects his waking state from the earliest years of his elementary school career until old age. In contrast, more normally advantaged males experience these periods of intense preoccupation for only comparatively short periods which seldom last for more than three weeks at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In most cases, once a child has actually initiated a friendship with the object of his dreams, his preoccupations rapidly diminish. And the more accessible the girl remains within his social environment, the less preoccupied he will feel. In essence, to the extent that he feels the sense of personal freedom necessary for talking with her whenever he desires, to that extent there will be no debilitating or distracting romantic preoccupation or infatuation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Social Supports</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most children enjoy a copious variety of social supports. The most important of these eminate from the peer group and the parents. For most children these two systems provide a range of enjoyable distractions. Young children tend to want to keep their romantic infatuations to themselves. But to the extent that they enjoy good relationships with their social support systems, to that extent young children are likely to share their preoccupations and worries. Once these preoccupations have been discussed with peers or parents, solutions are likely to be gener-ated. There is strength in numbers. And whereas prepubescent children</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 6 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasionally tease each other about romantic interests,  <i class="calibre4"> "best</i> friends" tend to learn about each other's innermost wishes. And they tend to help one another out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parents vary in their sophistication and sensitivity regarding heterosexual love matters. One self-confident non-shy respondent recounted this story from his past:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember I was in the sixth grade, and there was this girl in the other sixth grade class whom I just adored. I didn't have the nerve to say anything to her. But whenever the kids were all out on the playground I used to stare at her whenever I got the chance. I remember two of my friends sort of had infatuations with some of the girls too. So they were understanding, but they weren't much help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One day my mother insisted that I tell her why I was so bleery-eyed all the time at the dinner table. She knew I wasn't myself and she guessed that I was in love. And when she said that I had to say</p>
<p class="calibre1">'yes', and I blushed. For the next several days she kept goading me into starting a conversation with her. And my dad kept telling me that my life would be a lot easier once I did. He told me that I was creating a problem for myself. And that it would all be pretty much solved once I talked to the girl, even if she rejected me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, what eventually happened was that Vince, who was this friend of mine, was having a birthday party. His mom and my mom were always good friends. And my mom got Vince's mom to invite this girl to his party. You know, when I first found out about it I was outraged. Like I was really embarrassed. But I have to admit that that is what solved my problem. I got to meet the girl at the party and we had a long talk. And from that time on I was never really shy anymore around girls. I've felt hesitant for short periods. But except for this time when I was in the sixth grade I never really suffered any really painful shyness." (21-year old non-shy man.) A key impediment to the effective prevention of loveshyness is that some parents maintain certain rigid ideas about when it is "right"</p>
<p class="calibre1">for boys and girls to become interested in each other. Such parents sincerely believe that the sixth grade is just "too damned early"—that such children are just "too young" and that loveshyness at this age is</p>
<p class="calibre1">"good for children".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though this point of view is understandable, I believe that it is a very socially deleterious perspective which must be countered through concerted educational efforts. Shyness is <i class="calibre4"> NEVER</i> "good". Shyness obviates free choice and self-determination, and it stands squarely in the way of responsible self-control and self-management. It is one thing for a child to decide out of rational self-interest to avoid exclusive love</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>2 7 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationships for a certain portion of his/her life. It is entirely another matter for a child to avoid love relationships as a result of shyness. The first child is <i class="calibre4"> in control</i> and <i class="calibre4"> in charge</i> of his/her own life. The second child is <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> in command of the ship that is his or her life. And that ship stands a great risk of aimlessly drifting into some rocky shoreline a derelict unless it is stalwartly and decisively directed at its helm.  <i class="calibre4"> The</i> <i class="calibre4">child is father to the man, </i> and children who learn the shyness script do not easily forget it. All too frequently their shyness learnings remain intractably welded in their minds, and they go through life loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, SHYNESS IS NEVER HEALTHY—not at <i class="calibre4"> any</i> age or for <i class="calibre4"> either</i> gender. Rational self-direction inspired by an internalized set of rational self-controls and a deep-seated feeling of self-worth and self-love is what a happy, productive life is all about. The parents in the above case interview were very wise, sensitive and caring. They exercised their rational ingenuity toward helping their son out of the self-destructive doldrums which deep-seated loveshy infatuations represent for people of <i class="calibre4"> any</i> age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever a child <i class="calibre4"> (prepubescent or older)</i> is in the throes of loveshyness inspired preoccupation, the <i class="calibre4"> best thing</i> that a caring parent, teacher or peer can do is to tactfully and creatively engineer a way of according that child an opportunity to meet and to enter into relaxed conversation with the object of his infatuations.
