  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">young men from all over the United States.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The SHI Inventory is composed of just twenty brief questions. Each of the twenty items presents a scenario involving the making of a friendly, assertive move vis-a-vis an attractive person of the opposite sex. For each of the twenty scenarios the young man taking the test simply indicates <i class="calibre4"> on a seven point scale</i> just how shy or non-shy he would be about making a friendly/assertive move vis-a-vis the girl described in the scenario. Scores on this instrument can range from a maximum of 140 (the non-shy end) to a minimum low of 20 (the extremely loveshy end).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mean or average score for normally self-confident American college and university men is 103.9. (The SHI Inventory can only be taken by males.) I decided to establish the score of <i class="calibre4"> 105</i> as the minimum required for acceptance into the non-shy sample. Thus the score of 105</p>
<p class="calibre1">is more than a point higher than the self-confident non-shy norm established by Twentyman and McFall.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>138 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mean or average SHI Inventory scores for each of the three groups of men studied for this book were as follows: Self-Confident Non-Shy Men: 114.3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Young (University) LoveShy Men: 47.8</p>
<p class="calibre1">Older LoveShy Men 38.6</p>
<p class="calibre1">General Mean for Healthy College Males: 103.9</p>
<p class="calibre1">The SHI Inventory is an outstanding diagnostic device. And because I am often asked about its content, for the convenience of interested readers I have provided the twenty scenarios it contains in Appendix I at the end of this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Older LoveShy Group</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The older loveshy group was composed of 100 virginal, single, never married men in the 35 to 50 year old age category. My original intention had been to obtain 200 men for the older loveshy group. But the required data became available to me all too slowly. So I decided that it would be far better to cut the sample off at 100 men than wait the additional two to three years that would have been required for the completion of 200 interviews from appropriate people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the 100 older loveshy men possessed all of the seven loveshyness characteristics that are delineated on page 000 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, they were all quite similar to the younger (university) loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given their much older ages, however, the older loveshy men had all lived with their conditions for much longer periods of time. And the ambiance of dreamy-eyed optimism that characterized a significant minority of the younger loveshys did not appear to exist at all for these older men. In fact, most of them appeared quite pessimistic about their loveshyness problems and cynical about the world and about women in general.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cooperation of the older loveshy men was obtained in two different ways: (1) 78 of the men were obtained via the posting of public bulletin board announcements, and (2) the cooperation of 22 of the men was obtained through the help of the owner-manager of a New York area commercial dating service.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Announcements were placed on the bulletin boards of a large number of laundermats throughout the greater Los Angeles and New York metropolitan areas. Each announcement indicated that respondents were needed for a study of severe shyness in informal man/woman situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The announcements indicated that the study was to be concerned with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 139</p>
<p class="calibre1">men in the 35 to 50 year age range who were still "single, never married"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">not out of choice</i> but because of chronic and severe shyness vis-a-vis appealing women in informal social situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As had been the case with the younger loveshys, the announcements made clear the fact that only heterosexual men were needed for the study. Interested respondents were asked to contact the researcher <i class="calibre4">by mail</i> with an indication of the times and places that would be convenient for the interview. The announcements advised that a mutually convenient time would be confirmed by return mail, and that $10 would be paid for each respondent's cooperation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the announcements that were used to attract the attention of the older loveshys pointed out that a key goal of the study was to help remedy and prevent all forms of shyness which impede comfortable and relaxed heterosexual interaction. I wanted to present myself as someone who had a compassionate interest in the plight of the loveshy, and who did not subscribe to the traditional view that shyness is entirely the victim's responsibility. As with the bulletin board announcements used to attract the younger loveshys, I pointed out that I was a licensed therapeutic counselor, and that I was deeply and sincerely interested in the development of techniques that might be used to engineer the painless remission of loveshyness symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Commercial Dating Service</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner or later a high proportion of severely loveshy men join commercial introduction services. This issue will be discussed at length in part three of this book. Because I had long been aware of the popularity of commercial dating services among loveshy men, I decided to contact the owner-managers of several such organizations in both the greater New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. I succeeded in obtaining interviews with six such owner-managers. Unfortunately, only one of these proved willing on my behalf to ask loveshy men if they would be willing to cooperate in this research investigation. This manager provided me with 62 names and addresses; and 46 of these men did meet the seven criteria for loveshyness delineated on page 000.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It turned out that 22 of the 46 men were in the 35 to 50 year age range. And these men were employed for the older loveshy sample.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The other 24 men were all in the 21 to 24 year age range; and I employed them for my younger loveshy sample. (By the way, 19 and 20 year old men are not eligible for membership in most commercial dating services because there aren't any available women that young or younger to whom to assign them.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>140 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">For ethical reasons, the cooperating dating service manager mailed a notice to each of the 62 men selected. This notice was included along with each man's monthly "matches". The notice concluded by asking the recipient to contact the dating service office by a specified date if he objected to his name and address being given to me. None of these men owned telephones—a fact which is "par for the course" among the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Importance of LOVEShyness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the people who have researched shyness up to now have concentrated upon <i class="calibre4"> general</i> shyness. In interviewing hundreds of young men it became very clear to me that only one form of shyness caused severe and chronic emotional pain. Only one form of shyness created feelings of deprivation so excruciatingly painful that it severely distracted and handicapped its victims' ability to concentrate on work, school, and other important facets of their everyday lives. I decided to call this form of shyness <i class="calibre4"> "loveshyness". </i> And it is, in essence, a painful bashfulness and behavioral inertia that effectively prevents its victims from making any kind of overtures vis-a-vis members of the opposite sex. Loveshyness is strongly associated with many of the more general forms of shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But since it is the most emotionally debilitating of all forms of shyness I decided that it is the form most deserving of research attention.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, many people are too shy to start conversations with strangers. And yet everyday people with this deficit manage to go through life perfectly happy and adequately well-adjusted. In short, many men with wives and children are too inhibited to deal in an open, friendly way vis-a-vis strangers—even though most of them might very much like to be able to do so. The fact that these people have their wives and children along with usually a small circle of friends serves to effectively cushion them against long-term feelings of unhappiness and depression. Men who are too shy to interact informally with women at all do not have and are effectively blocked from obtaining this cushion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A condition known as <i class="calibre4"> "speech reticence" </i> represents another area of shyness that has received a good deal of research attention lately. But a person can go all the way through life without <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> getting up to make a speech (or entertain), and still be at least satisfactorily happy if not very happy. To be sure, speech reticence can impede career advancement. In some fields of endeavor it can even obviate success. However, most careers do not require the ability to engage in public speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And whereas a speech professor might view serious deficits in this area as "tragic" or "intolerable", in point of fact the large apathetic "silent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 141</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority" does not appear to have its lives cramped very much by this problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But more importantly, a relative dearth or absence of "speech reticence"  <i class="calibre4"> does not assure</i> against loveshyness. Almost <i class="calibre4"> three out of every ten</i> <i class="calibre4">loveshy men</i> interviewed for this study were not at all afraid to talk publicly. In fact, many of them greatly relished every opportunity they could obtain for talking or entertaining in some way before the public.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These men were shy only in situations where there is no script—where there is no clearly defined, non-ambiguous role to play. Hence, many loveshys are shy only in situations where there is no purpose apart from pure, unadulterated sociability. Let this sort of person talk before a large audience and he will enjoy every minute of it. On the other hand, put this person in a coctail party situation, or worse yet in a one-on-one situation with a woman whom he finds attractive,  <i class="calibre4"> and he will freeze. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, in all candor I must agree that seventy percent of the loveshys I studied <i class="calibre4"> were</i> too shy to speak publicly. However, it appears quite clear that any remedying of this deficit would in no way assure a remission of the loveshyness problem. In fact, even if a shy person could be turned into an outstanding public speaker, this would in no way assure him of what he will need to secure the affectionate female companionship that he so greatly needs and requires.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moral here is simply that of <i class="calibre4"> let's take first things first. </i> An inability to function in a purely social, sociable situation wherein there is no purpose apart from pure friendliness, is far more debilitating to a person's personal, social,  <i class="calibre4"> and business</i> life, than is any inability to deliver speeches or any inability to start conversations with strangers. Simply put, we will be serving the needs of mankind far better if we focus our attentions upon the alleviating and curing of loveshyness. The other forms of shyness are of far less importance and can for the most part be ignored. To the extent that a person has his loveshyness remedied, to that extent the other forms of shyness with which he may be afflicted will eventually take care of themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Summary</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The major purpose of this chapter has been to present an easily understandable discussion (1) of respondent characteristics, and (2) of the methods that were employed for obtaining the research information.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Academic readers might feel that the discussion presented here is too brief. However, this book was written primarily with the lay reader in mind. Loveshyness is a very serious, painful problem that requires a much better understanding than presently prevails in our society. I believe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>142 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a widespread dissemination of knowledge regarding this problem is very necessary. There is no way loveshyness can be effectively remedied and prevented without such a dissemination of research knowledge. Moreover, people must be able to properly understand knowledge in order to be able to make any kind of constructive use of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three different groups of men were studied for this research. Simply put, there were two loveshy groups and one <i class="calibre4"> comparison group</i> that was composed of 200 <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> individuals. The 200 non-shys were all university men between the ages of 19 and 24. Similarly, one of the loveshy groups was composed of 200 university men who were between the ages of 19 and 24. The second loveshy group was composed of 100 men in the 35 to 50 year age category. The cooperation of all three groups was obtained primarily through the aid of posted bulletin board announcements. The two 19 to 24 year old groups were both drawn primarily from seven different universities. The 100 older loveshy men were drawn entirely from the New York and Los Angeles greater metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seven criteria were used for this study in determining who is and who is not "loveshy". Briefly, all respondents in both loveshy groups possessed each and every one of these seven characteristics: (1) all were male; (2) all were strictly heterosexual; (3) all were virginal; (4) all very strongly desired a romantically intimate relationship with a woman; (5) all very rarely or never dated; (6) all lacked a personal history that incorporated any meaningful romantic and/or sexual relationships with women; and (7) all suffered strong anxiety pains at the mere thought of making an assertive move towards the initiation of a relationship with a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, this chapter presented a discussion on how heterosexuals could be accurately distinguished from homosexuals. This is an important issue because loveshy heterosexuals are often misperceived and publicly mislabeled "homosexual" as a result of their never being observed interacting informally with women. New diagnostic categories such as (1) the <i class="calibre4"> closet heterosexual, </i> and (2) the <i class="calibre4"> male lesbian, </i> were also introduced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And their key relevancy to loveshyness among heterosexual males was explained and discussed. Attention was also accorded such issues as (1) why this investigation was designed to study males only, and (2) why loveshyness was studied rather than other kinds of shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">NOTE:</i> In Appendix III of this book the reader will find a table which summarizes the mean <i class="calibre4"> Eysenck Personality Questionnaire</i> (EPQ) scores for the non-shy and the loveshy samples.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>Chapter 6</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Beginnings</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now, most of the people who have written about shyness have been of the opinion that learning accounts for all. This view holds that shyness is the natural outcome of years of negative learning, and of a negative self-image. Inasmuch as the self-image is always the cumulative byproduct of all of a person's past learnings, shyness according to this view can only be cured through a process of rational re-education and resocialization.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Learning <i class="calibre4"> is</i> a matter of utmost importance. But as far as severe shyness is concerned it is only part of the total picture. Years of intensively studying and researching shyness have convinced me that therapists, parents, and others who attempt to cure shyness without the benefit of a <i class="calibre4"> balanced perspective</i> will achieve only very limited results. A key problem is that the psychology of learning is an intellectual <i class="calibre4"> ideology</i> AS WELL AS a body of empirically verifiable knowledge. Ideology by its very nature <i class="calibre4"> always</i> creates blinders. And these blinders militate against the much needed development of a balanced perspective. In fact, a person cannot even become aware of a body of knowledge that he/she has (motivated by ideology) never even bothered to read.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The East German Research</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the surface communist East Germany would seem to be one of the least likely places to produce important research findings pertinent to the loveshyness problem. However, for many years East German officials have been endeavoring to obtain distinction for their country by getting their youth to score very highly and even to win most of the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards this end East Germany does everything in its power to involve youth (and especially young boys) in demanding athletic activity 143</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>144 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">as early in their lives as possible. Their goal is to produce outstanding athletes. And boys who for whatever reasons (1) perform inadequately at physical activity, and/or (2) who display less than an enthusiastic attitude, interest, and motivation with respect to such activity, remain at the bottom of the social status and prestige ladder among their peers and vis-a-vis the adult community as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because such highly masculine, strenuous activities are so important to the East Germans, they have tried to find out (1) why some boys remain uninterested in athletic, "rough and tumble" activity, and (2) whether anything can be done to successfully get disinterested boys involved in such activity. With respect to the second question the East Germans learned early in their investigative efforts that the application of psychological pressure often made matters worse rather than better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the disinterested children tended to become even more disinterested quite in spite of burgeoning social unpopularity and an ever increasing public ostracism eminating from all-make peer groups and athletic coaches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that there is a strong relationship for boys between athletic disinterest/incompetence and loveshyness will be amply documented in the chapter on the all-male peer group. The point that needs to be stressed here is the fact that the East Germans would not allow a disinterest among boys in athletic achievement to go unstudied. As they see it, not being interested in athletics is "unnatural" for boys; and this is a feeling that is widely shared among physical education teachers and parents here in American society. But in America the tendency has long been to "get into a kid's head" through extensive psychological tests and interviews. In contrast, the East Germans have long believed in commencing an investigation with a detailed probing of the nonconformist's anatomy, physiology, and body biochemistry. Simply put, the East Germans have been conditioned to look first to the medical laboratory for the answers they seek.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Blood Testosterone</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The first finding to be uncovered by the East German research was that many of the boys who had been disinclined towards "rough and tumble" play had below average amounts of the male hormone <i class="calibre4"> testosterone</i> in their blood. This was especially true for boys whose size and weight had always been quite normal, but who still sustained a disinterest in body contact sports and strenuous athletics.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the East Germans' first thoughts was that they had uncovered a hormonal and biochemical basis for homosexuality. Like all politically fascist states, East German leaders have long detested anything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 145</p>
<p class="calibre1">which smacks of homosexuality. Thus the scientists there fully believed that anyone who could uncover a cure for homosexuality would gain a formidable amount of professional status and prestige.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it turned out that very few of the low testosterone boys grew up to become homosexuals. In fact, incipient homosexuality turned out to be only very slightly more common among the low testosterone boys than among those with normal levels of blood testosterone. On the other hand, the boys who had low blood testosterone continue to remain uninterested in "rough and tumble" athletics. And as young adults they took longer than their peers in obtaining the love interest of a female partner—a fact which had created quite a bit of unhappiness for them. Obviously, this is a reflection of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the most remarkable finding to be uncovered by the East German scientists was the fact that a strong relationship was discovered between (1) a pregnant woman's personality, and (2) her male fetus'</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood testosterone level. The East Germans focused upon the pregnancies of a large group of mothers. And it was found that certain personality traits of a pregnant woman had the effect of <i class="calibre4"> neutralizing</i> either the testosterone that is released into the bloodstream of the fetus, or the enzymes which metabolize the testosterone to the point of permitting it to do its job on the various parts of the male fetus' brain that nature has programmed to respond to testosterone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Personality traits of a pregnant woman deemed by this research to have a deleterious influence upon the propitious development of a male fetus are: (1) irascibility, (2) tenseness, (3) truculent abrasiveness, (4) irritability, (5) depression, (6) high strung and volatile, (7) petulance, and (8) cantankerousness. Most of the mothers studied retained these personality traits long after their babies were born. But the important point to be stressed here is that these traits of personality <i class="calibre4"> in a pregnant</i> <i class="calibre4">mother</i> had the effect of neutralizing testosterone and/or related enzymes, and thus <i class="calibre4"> feminizing</i> yet-to-be-born male offspring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Equally important in the findings of the East German scientists was the fact <i class="calibre4"> that girl fetuses</i> carried by tense, irascible mothers did not possess any noticeably abnormal traits. The brain "of a female fetus is not programmed by nature to respond in any way to the <i class="calibre4"> presence or absence</i> of testosterones. In fact,  <i class="calibre4"> unlike a boy fetus</i> a girl fetus is not biologically programmed by nature to have her blood stream bathed in testosterones in the first place! Thus the absence of such hormones can do no damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, in East Germany as in America, it is "okey" for a girl to be femine and passive, and not too enthusiastic about "rough and tumble" sports. Consequently, even if a <i class="calibre4"> female fetus</i> were to be excessively feminized as a result of its mother's personality, there would be little in the form of <i class="calibre4"> social</i> consequences. A passive boy owns a low social stimulus</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>146 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">value; he is vulnerable to being either bullied or ignored. A passive girl, on the other hand, owns a neutral to positive social stimulus value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People are not likely to ignore or bully her simply because she behaves passively. More succinctly, a boy fetus is much more vulnerable than a girl fetus to things going wrong during the course of its intrauterine development.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The idea that what goes on in the mind affects what goes on in the body is not new. Indeed, the body of knowledge known as psychosomatic medicine and holistic medicine has been expanding enormously in recent years. But what has been ignored until now is the fact that what goes on in the mind of a pregnant woman affects the fetus, and it does so in a host of ways. We have learned that hormonal and enzyme imbalances in a fetus are easily created by the type of attitude, personality, and approach to life a woman normally sustains. If her normal personality is tense and irascible or depressed, she is likely to give birth to a feminized <i class="calibre4"> (pre-shy)</i> boy baby.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, just as a tense, irascible, high strung or depressed woman will very likely give birth to a <i class="calibre4"> pre-shy</i> baby (if that baby is a boy), a relaxed, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky woman who does not take life too seriously will typically give birth to a highly masculine baby. And that is exactly what the East German researchers found. More succinctly, the more relaxed, sociable and non-serious a pregnant woman normally is, the greater the likelihood that any male babies born to her will be highly masculine, energetic, and naturally ready to enter enthusiastically into the "rough and tumble" of boyish play. On the other hand, the further down the continuum a pregnant woman normally falls in terms of hyperseriousness, tenseness, irritability, petulance, etc., the more passive, withdrawn,  <i class="calibre4"> and shy</i> her <i class="calibre4"> male children</i> are likely to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These traits in a mother's personality are, of course, also bound to affect the learning that a child does during the early years of his post partum life. Indeed, as I shall show later, some of these maternal traits may even provoke loveshyness by rendering boys fearful and distrustful of getting close to a woman. However, the thing we are most concerned about in this chapter is the fact that these maternal personality traits have a strong impact upon the native, inborn biology and physiology of a boy child. And this is true quite irrespective of genetic considerations.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Relevant American Research Efforts</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus far little of this type of research has been conducted here in America. And most of what has been done has been conducted on animals. However, the same type of findings seem to be coming to the fore. As a case in point, two American researchers subjected pregnant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterinc Beginnings 147</p>
<p class="calibre1">rats to stress by confining them in a small cage under very bright lights.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They found, in essence, that the rats'  <i class="calibre4"> male</i> offspring had low levels of testosterone, and they exhibited passive, shy, and socially withdrawn behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">American research has also established that neonate little girl babies react much more negatively to physical pain stimuli than do little boy babies. The loveshy males studied for this book were much more sensitive to physical pain than were the non-shy males. This finding similarly suggests that the brains of most of the loveshy men studied for this book had not been appropriately masculinized prior to their respective births.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The greater liking for sweets that has long been known to prevail among girl babies as opposed to boy babies also seems to have prevailed among the loveshy males who were interviewed for this book. For example, the much higher prevalence of reactive hypoglycemia among the loveshys (versus the non-shys) would appear to reflect this penchant for sugar among loveshy men. (See the chapter on medical symptoms for a more detailed discussion of this issue.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">My Own Findings</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a social scientist I had no legal way of testing the blood testosterone levels for each of the 500 men studied. Further, for truly incisive data it would have been necessary to obtain blood samples from each one of the men during the time when they were still fetuses yet to be born! On the other hand, my study did turn up a substantial amount of data which lend strong support to the proposition that severely loveshy males had been feminized while still in the uterus. Simply put, most of my loveshy respondents had been born to mothers with the personality syndrome characterized by tenseness, irascibility, cantankerousness, high irritability, depression, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Moreover, an unusually high proportion of the mothers of my loveshy respondents had had significant problems in the management of their pregnancies.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Miscarriages and Stillbirths</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked each respondent whether or not his mother had had any miscarriages either before or after he was born. Only 12</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shy men responded in the affirmative, compared to 26 percent of the younger loveshys and 31 percent of the older loveshys. And in response to a question about whether or not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>148 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mother had ever had any babies born dead (stillbirths), fully 42</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys responded in the affirmative, compared to only 5 percent of the self-confident non-shy men. The analogous figure for the younger loveshy men was 36 percent, which is itself a very high figure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The issue of miscarriages and stillbirths is of significance to our understanding of the etiology of loveshyness in two different respects: (1) the miscarriage or stillbirth may represent a psychosomatic reflection of the possibility that deep down inside a woman does not really want to have a live and healthy child. Secondly (2), female hormones that are being taken today by an ever increasing number of pregnant women have been found to cause mild degrees of hermaphroditism in growing fetuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second point may be one of considerable importance. For many years now female hormones have been prescribed as a means of <i class="calibre4"> preventing miscarriages and stillbirths. </i> Of course, I had no way of finding out whether or not the loveshy's mothers had taken female hormones during the course of their respective pregnancies. However, since 31 percent of the mothers of the older loveshys had been prone to miscarriages, compared to only 12 percent of the non-shys' mothers, there is at least some possibility that a few of the loveshy men might have been feminized while intrautero by the female hormones which their mothers had taken in an effort to prevent miscarriage and stillbirths. Again, the difference between the loveshys and the non-shys had been even greater with regard to the matter of stillbirths: 42 percent of the older loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">mothers had had one or more stillbirths compared to just 5 percent of the mothers of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Infant Mortality Issue</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each man: "How many times did your mother have a baby that died within a few days or a week of when it was born?" Let us consider the percent of men who indicated <i class="calibre4"> "once or more times" </i> in response to this question. More specifically, 47 percent of the older loveshys and 44 percent of the younger loveshys responded that it had happened <i class="calibre4"> "once or more times". </i> Zero percent (nobody) of the self-confident non-shy men gave me a similar response. In essence, whereas <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the mothers of the non-shy men had ever had this experience,  <i class="calibre4"> almost</i> <i class="calibre4">half</i> of the men in the two loveshy groups had mothers who at one time had had a baby that died within a few days of birth. These differences are extremely remarkable and noteworthy. And it is to be hoped that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 149</p>
<p class="calibre1">other researchers will soon check them out with their own samples and corroborate them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Pains of Giving Birth</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Birth is a painful experience for most if not all women. Yet the large majority of women seldom if ever complain about the pain they had endured while giving birth. Even fewer women complain to their children about such pain. Moreover, nature seems to have a way of making most women forget the pains and discomforts which accompany the childbirth experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless I asked each respondent whether his mother had complained a lot about the pain and stress she had suffered and endured while giving birth—to him. And not surprisingly,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the self-confident non-shy men responded in the affirmative. On the other hand, 16 percent of the older loveshys and 12 percent of the younger loveshys replied that their mothers had complained quite a bit about the pains and stresses that had been related to giving birth to the respondent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I then asked each man to react to the statement: "It took me a good deal longer to be born than most babies take." And 27 percent of the older loveshys together with 21 percent of the younger loveshys responded in the affirmative. In contrast, only 4 percent of the non-shy men believed that it had taken them a good deal longer to be born than most babies require.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is interesting to note that several research studies have found obstetrical complications to increase the risk of the newborn child eventually developing a schizoid disorder (see Wender and Klein, 1981). This is especially so if the mother or father of the child happens to be carrying a schizoid-predisposing gene. (The gene <i class="calibre4"> may</i> render the young child susceptible to being invaded by a schizoid-inducing virus.) Prolonged labor has been found to be the complication that is most consistently associated with an increased risk of developing a schizoid personality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, some measure of oxygen-deprivation may be implicated here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Schizoid personality disorders are much milder than the far more serious, psychotic condition known as schizophrenia. However, like schizophrenia the schizoidia condition is chronic; and there is strong evidence that it (or a susceptibility to it) is inherited genetically. The schizoid personality may be of considerable relevance to extreme loveshyness. Thus, schizoids tend to be quite shy and withdrawn. They are in touch with reality, and many of them tend to be quite intelligent. But they lack a normal capacity for responding warmly to others, making and keeping friends, or of evoking warm or friendly responses in other</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>150 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">people. They are typically seen as distant, aloof, estranged and peculiar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as with loveshy males, they grow up as friendless social isolates who are heavily bullied and hazed by age-mate peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also similar to loveshy men, they do not respond well at the outset to attempts to bring them out of their shells—unless these attempts are unusually persistent and well organized. Their ability to experience pleasure is greatly below average, especially the pleasure of informal sociable interaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Premature Births and Caesarean Sections</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent whether or not he had been born prematurely.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shy men responded in the affirmative. In contrast, 16 percent of the older loveshy men along with 13 percent of the younger loveshy men had been born prematurely. I also asked: "At your birth, were you delivered by Caesarean section?" And 14 percent of the older loveshys together with 11 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4">had been. </i> Zero percent (nobody) of the self-confident non-shys had been delivered by Caesarean section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1968 only 5 percent of all American births were delivered by Caesarean section. In 1983, only about half as many babies are delivered per doctor as had been the case in 1968. Yet each doctor delivers <i class="calibre4"> five</i> <i class="calibre4">times as many</i> babies by Caesarean section today, in 1983, as had been the case in 1968. Hence, if Caesarean section births are related in any way to loveshyness or to any other psychoemotional problem, the current situation does not bode well for the future. The paradox, of course, is that pregnant women are healthier today than they had been in 1968.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem is that obstetricians don't have nearly as many babies to deliver today as they used to have. Obstetricians are the highest paid of all medical specialists; and the only way they can sustain their very high incomes is to intimidate women in labor into getting a great many quite unnecessary Caesarean sections.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Painful Menopause</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' mothers seemed to have many more psychosomatic complaints than did the mothers of the non-shys. For example, 29 percent of the older loveshys together with 23 percent of the younger loveshys recalled their mother as having had an unusually long and painful menopause. In contrast, only 4 percent of the self-confident non-shys recalled their mothers as having had difficulties with the menopause.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 151</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Briquet's Syndrome</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In listening to the loveshys discuss their mothers it became apparent to me that a large fraction of these women may have suffered from a chronic, usually lifelong condition known as <i class="calibre4"> Briquet's syndrome. </i> This is an hysterical disorder in which the patient is almost always female; and it is estimated to occur in between one and two percent of all women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically, it entails complaining about a multitude of different physical difficulties over a period of many years. Normally unattributable to any underlying physical disease, the symptoms include headache, numb-ness, tingling, palpitations, shortness of breath, pain during coitus, painful joints and a host of painful abdominal complaints. Because of the host of continuing complaints, such patients often convince their exasperated physicians that genuine physical disease may lie at the root of their problems. Thus, a myriad of exploratory surgical procedures are often performed on these women. Such women typically endeavor to derive secondary gain (sympathy and a plethora of special considerations) from their families. But because their personalities are so abrasive and truculently irritable—especially vis-a-vis their loveshy sons, they seldom enjoy much success in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LoveShys as Quite Babies</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At one point in the interview I asked each man to react to the statement: "My mother used to comment from time to time that I was a rather quiet baby, and that I didn't cry very much." I decided that if the loveshys agreed with this statement to a significantly greater extent than the non-shys, it would provide further support for the view that the intrauterine stage of existence had had a feminizing effect on the loveshy men. Of course, I realized that many mothers might never have said anything, even if their children had been very quiet as infants. I also realized that many people might very easily have forgotten comments of this nature made by their mothers many years ago. Nevertheless, if the respondent had indeed been a quiet baby, it seemed to me that he would be at least somewhat likely to vaguely remember maternal comments to that effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 16 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed that their mothers had indeed commented from time to time about the fact that they had been quiet babies. In stark contrast, fully 86 percent of the older loveshys and 73 percent of the younger loveshys agreed that their mothers had occasionally made this comment about them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>152 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with all the problems entailed by a question of this nature which places a heavy emphasis upon memory and recall, it seems highly unlikely that the loveshys would remember such a comment whereas the self-confident non-shys would not be able to remember it. Furthermore, when it is taken into account that (1) throughout their formative years the loveshys had gotten along with their mothers a good deal less well than the non-shys had gotten along with theirs, and (2) the fact that a quiet baby is considered by most people to be easier to care for than a normally noisy one, it would appear unlikely that the mothers had been lying in their comments about the loveshy child having been a quiet baby. Indeed, the loveshys' mothers had been so hypercritical that it seems highly improbable that they would cast praise upon their children for having been quiet babies—unless their children had indeed been unusually quiet at that time of life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the loveshy men studied for this research had most probably been unusually quiet babies who had been born to tense, high-strung, depressed and irascible women. Further, the loveshys' mothers had experienced formidable difficulties in the management of their pregnancies and of the childbirth process itself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mothers' Personalities</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked numerous questions about the mothers' personalities. Most of these data will be covered in chapter eight. However, some of the findings need to be discussed here. For example, I asked each man to respond to the statement: "My mother was an extremely tense, high strung person who would often burst into great rages." Note that this question deals directly with the <i class="calibre4"> same traits of personality</i> which the East Germans found to be related to the giving of birth to feminized boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, tense, high strung, irascible women by virtue of their mental state cause too little testosterone (and related enzymes) to be released within their male fetuses. As indicated earlier, this situation appears to be a clear antecedent of loveshyness in males, but not in females.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 38 percent of the older loveshys and 31 percent of the younger loveshys replied that their mothers had indeed been high strung and extremely tense women who would frequently burst into great rages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> only 4 percent</i> of the self-confident non-shy men saw their mothers as having been this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another representative question is the following: "My mother was always easily angered and very prone to outbursts of temper." Fully 53</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 47 percent of the younger ones</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 153</p>
<p class="calibre1">responded in the affirmative, compared to just 20 percent of the non-shys. And to the statement: "My mother was always a patient person", 54 percent of the non-shys replied <i class="calibre4"> "true", </i> compared with only 13 percent of the older loveshys and 19 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two further examples of maternal personality which are appropriate for review here at the following: "When my mother became angry with me during childhood, she would often say and do some very strange and bizarre things." Fully 41 percent of the older loveshys and 36 percent of the younger ones agreed with this statement, compared to only 13 percent of the self-confident non-shys. And in response to the statement: "My mother often threw uncontrollably loud, angry temper tantrums at me",  <i class="calibre4"> fully 45 percent</i> of the older loveshys and 39 percent of the younger loveshys agreed, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As bizarre as it might sound to some readers, some of the loveshys' mothers would bring up the subject of childbirth-related pain and suffering whenever they were angry and upset about their son's misbehavior or seeming lack of consideration. For some of the loveshys, these maternal rages were frequent, sometimes daily occurrences. Some of the loveshy respondents spoke of their mothers' temper tantrums as constituting a kind of uncontrolled fit that could last for several hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following quote from a 35-year old loveshy man should provide the reader with some idea as to the truculent, ego-deflating, persistently belittling, chronic irascibility that many of these women would display.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You may find it hard to believe this. I know some of the psychiatrists I've seen have a hard time dealing with it. But from the time I was about four or five until I was about fifteen or sixteen my mother would have these angry fits. Oh, I guess she would have them about every ten to fourteen days or so—whenever she was so angry about something that she just couldn't control herself. Well, one of the things she would do was rip off her underwear and force me to look at the scar from the excruciatingly painful operation she said she had to have when she gave birth to me. I mean she would just rip every damn thing off in a loud and screaming rage and she'd force me to look at her pussy and this scar that she screamed was so horrendously painful. Then she'd flail her arms all over the place and start throwing silverware and coat hangers. And this would go on like for a half-hour or more sometimes. Then she'd grab this really long butcher knife we kept in the silverware drawer. And she'd show it to me, still screaming at the top of her lungs. And she'd hollar that she was going to commit suicide with it. And then she'd run shouting and screaming into the bathroom, and she'd lock herself in there. At that point she'd usually stop screaming. She'd just cry and cry and cry, loudly and then softly. And like I said, that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>154 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">would sometimes go on for three or four hours before she'd finally go to bed and sleep it off."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And a 40-year old loveshy man had this to offer:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen, for several years while I was growing up I don't think a single day ever went by when my mother wouldn't rant and rave about something. She would hollar at the top of her lungs, sometimes for hours, about what kind of goddam sonofabitch and rotten cur I was, and how she wished I was dead or that I'd be hit by a car or something. Then when she would come out of it she would give me all this loving bullshit about how she loved me. And she would try to stroke my head, and I just wanted to get away from her. I couldn't stand her! Even her breath stunk all the time I remember!</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember one time she got into some kind of argument with her cousin. I remember this well because I remember I was in kindergarten that year. And I can remember the whole flavor behind what happened. Like one day when I came home from kindergarten—</p>
<p class="calibre1">they let us go around 12:30 in the afternoon—I walked in and she said there was something she wanted me to do. She said she wanted me to tell this man she was going to dial on the phone how she was going to come back and haunt him when she dies, and all this stuff about how mean and rotten a cur he was and all this. And I remember I was too shy to do it. Well, she accused me of being in collusion with her cousin. And she started screaming and shouting at me and about what a horrible bastard I was if I didn't say these horrible things to the man she dialed. I remember I finally had to do it for her; but I felt horrible and it was very traumatic for me even though I don't remember the guy actually said anything to me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, living throughout one's formative years with a woman manifesting this type of personality could well have inspired the development on a subconscious level of a generalized fear and mistrust of women in general. In essence, maternal tenseness, irascibility, petulance, etc., which the East Germans found to be a cause behind the feminization of male fetuses was quite a widespread feature of the personalities of the mothers of the loveshys who were studied for this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Maternal Bashfulness During Pregnancy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Further support for the view that mothers who give birth to chronically loveshy boys are much more nervous and tense than women whose sons do not develop chronic loveshyness can be seen in the pattern of responses to this statement: "My mother probably felt shy or tense or embarrassed about being seen pregnant by people." It should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 155</p>
<p class="calibre1">be noted that <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the loveshy men studied for this book had been born out of wedlock. There was no rational reason for any of the mothers to have felt nervous or anxious about being seen pregnant. Still, 78</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys together with 66 percent of the younger loveshys guessed that their mothers had indeed felt shy or tense or embarrassed about being seen while pregnant. Only 11 percent of the non-shy men felt this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Mothers' Employment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tense, petulant women are probably less likely to be employed over very much time than are women who can maintain a genuinely relaxed, flexible, sociable attitude towards people and towards life. With regard to this I asked each man: "Was your mother employed during most of the period during which she was pregnant with you?" And here again, there were pronounced differences among the three groups of men studied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, twenty to forty years ago it was quite a bit less commonplace than it is today for a woman to remain employed throughout her pregnancy. Many employers used to insist that their pregnant employees quit their jobs either upon becoming pregnant or by the fifth month at the latest. Because of this difference between today and yes-teryear I offered each man interviewed three different responses: 1. Yes; she was employed throughout most of the pregnancy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. No, she was not employed. But she remained very active socially during this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. No, and she probably remained indoors most of the time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, each man interviewed had to guess at the true state of affairs at the time he was still intrautero. Nevertheless, the results I obtained provided confirmation for my earlier findings that mothers of chronically and intractably loveshy men tended to have engaged in quite a bit of social avoidance behavior, especially in regard to an employment situation wherein they might be judged, or wherein the true nature of their personalities might not be so easy to hide over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, just 10 percent of the mothers of the non-shys had been employed during most of their pregnancy periods. However,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (none) of the mothers of the loveshy men had been employed during their pregnancies. There was no difference between the older and the younger loveshys on this issue.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of their mothers had been employed during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>156 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most illuminating of the three possible responses was "no, and she probably remained indoors most of the time."  <i class="calibre4"> Only 11 percent</i> of the non-shy men saw fit to select this response, compared to 52</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshy men and 67 percent of the older loveshy men. In essence, the more severe the loveshyness, the more socially avoidant (and responsibility avoidant) the mothers of these loveshy men had been. As for those indicating "no, she was not employed; but she remained very active socially during this time", the responses were 79 percent for the non-shy men, 48 percent for the younger loveshy men, and 33 percent for the older loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Employment Among Mothers of Teenagers</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas it had not been considered socially acceptable until recently for conspicuously pregnant women to remain employed, it has long been considered acceptable for mothers of older children to work. Hence, I wanted to find out the extent to which the various groups of mothers had been employed outside the home during the years when the respondents were between 10 and 18 years of age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The obtained findings revealed that <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of the older loveshys' mothers together with 67 percent of the mothers of the younger loveshys had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> been employed while their children were growing up—not even during the period when their children were between the ages of 10 and 18. In contrast, this was true for only 19 percent of the mothers of the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, 54 percent of the non-shys' mothers had been employed <i class="calibre4"> full-time</i> during this period. This was true for only 20 percent of the younger loveshys' mothers, and for a mere 11 percent of the mothers of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In America we tend to be quite moralistic about mothers spending enough time with their growing children. And yet various research studies have made it clear that it is the <i class="calibre4"> quality</i> of the time spent with children that matters, and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> the quantity. The loveshy men quite obviously had had their mothers around quite a bit more often than the non-shy men did. Yet it would appear that the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> personality traits which had made it difficult for the mothers to obtain and keep employment had <i class="calibre4"> also</i> served to reinforce the sons' loveshyness traits and social withdrawal tendencies. First, these maternal traits had probably operated to neutralize the operation of the testosterones and related enzymes while the sons were still intrautero. After birth, these maternal traits had probably served to further exacerbate damage already done. In essence, maternal personality traits probably had an important bearing upon <i class="calibre4"> both the nature and the nurture</i> of shyness. Thus, these maternal</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 157</p>
<p class="calibre1">traits had probably affected both the inborn biology of shyness as well as post-partum social learning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aggravating the noxious impact of the mothers' personality upon the loveshy was the relatively high degree of social isolation found in their homes and in their kinship networks. This is one of the issues that will be dealt with in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Issue of Prevention</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ultimate test of the true worth of any book is the extent to which its findings can be used towards preventive efforts. If severe, chronic loveshyness can be prevented from developing in the first place, a tremendous amount of human suffering can be averted. Let us consider some of the ways whereby this might be accomplished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, preschool, kindergarten, first, second and third grade boys who are clearly shy, socially withdrawn and avoidant of "rough and tumble" play might be given shots of testosterone from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is what is currently being done in East Germany, and with a considerable amount of success. Only very small amounts of the hormone need be injected at any one time. However, such hormonal treatment must be accomplished while a child is still young. Once a shy, socially withdrawn boy has gotten as far as the fifth or sixth grade, it may already be too late for hormonal injections to do much good. This is because the self-image normally begins to crystallize by the time a child is 11 or 12 years of age. Thus, by age 12 a boy will normally have developed a negative mental attitude towards both himself and others as a result of the consistently nasty way he has been treated by male peers. His self-image will have become intractably negative, and he will have come to define himself as emotionally incapable of social assertiveness and/or as plainly uninterested in traditionally masculine activities such as "rough and tumble" play. Hence, the earlier such treatment can be started, the better the hope for a cure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We know that girls who are unpopular with their same-sexed peer group are often quite popular with boys. Unfortunately, the reverse is <i class="calibre4">NOT</i> true. Boys who are unpopular vis-a-vis their same-sexed peers virtually never have an easy time asserting themselves in a friendly way with girls. The all-male peer group provides males with the crucial interpersonal skills and the necessary social self-confidence for rewarding heterosexual interaction. It also provides them with a social network that can prove very useful for making introductions to members of the opposite sex. Therefore, anything which effectively contributes to a boy's capacity for winning the respect and companionship of his male peers will inevitably contribute to his capacity to interact successfully with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>158 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">girls as well. Injections of testosterone early in a passive boy's life might help to insure his later happiness and social effectiveness.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prevention efforts must also be launched with respect to the <i class="calibre4"> mothers. </i> Gynecologists, obstetricians and pediatricians all need to be alerted to the seemingly shy, ultra-polite, but actually quite petulant, irascible, truculent (vis-a-vis her son) woman.2 It is expected that by the turn of the century it may be possible for couples to select the gender of the babies they procreate. Women with the kinds of personality traits specified in this chapter could then be directed towards having <i class="calibre4"> female</i> offspring only—or perhaps no offspring at all. Since pregnant women who are tense, high strung, etc., can do little or no harm to female fetuses but a great deal of harm to male fetuses, great good might be accomplished by assuring that such women have girl babies only.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would also make good sense for kindergarten and first grade teachers to make note of chronically passive, socially retiring (isolated) boys who are in their charge. This would permit special clinical services to be made available to these boys and to their families (particularly their mothers). These services might include "Parent-Effectiveness Training"</p>
<p class="calibre1">seminars, parents of shy and inhibited children support groups, as well as parent-group therapy, Parents Anonymous groups, and play therapy sessions for the afflicted children themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, in order to provide such services there must be adequate funding of the various social services that can constructively impact upon children. Not only is such funding hard to come by, but those parents whose sons are most in need of help are usually the most reluctant to accept any help or guidance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Women who are tense, high strung, poison-tongued vis-a-vis their sons, etc., are usually quite conservative and conventional. In essence, they tend to be <i class="calibre4"> highly defensive</i> about their own shortcomings as these are reflected in the inadequate social behavior of their sons. Generally speaking, the more secure a person is, the more willing she or he will be to admit that she or he does not know all the right answers, or how to put those right answers to work in practical, everyday life situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Insecure people tend to fear negative evaluations and want to run and hide from any possibility of same. And <i class="calibre4"> this</i> is the most difficult barrier to be overcome in helping socially isolated, pre-shy little boys. In fact, I would say that it is a substantially more formidable obstacle than any shortfall of economic funding.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the course of the interviews I conducted for this book, many of the shyest men spontaneously mentioned that their parents had been strongly encouraged by school officials to obtain therapeutic aid. Very often therapeutic help had been offered for the parents and for the child himself. And often this help had been offered free of charge. Moreover,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>LoveShyness: Its Intrauterine Beginnings 159</p>
<p class="calibre1">in quite a few instances it had been offered repeatedly <i class="calibre4"> (and repeatedly</i> <i class="calibre4">turned down)</i> while the boy was still in kindergarten or the first grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, if any campaign to <i class="calibre4"> prevent shyness</i> is to achieve success, it must first successfully address the problem of the very weak, highly vulnerable egos <i class="calibre4"> of the parents</i> of the pre-love-shy boys. In spite of all the consciousness raising that has been going on in America over the past two decades, many people still feel that they <i class="calibre4"> own</i> their children, and that successful parenting skills are instinctual. In their defensiveness, many weak-ego parents will persistently sell themselves a false bill of goods that even chronic, long-term passivity in their sons is merely a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"passing stage" that will be "outgrown" in time if just let alone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, children <i class="calibre4"> do</i> outgrow <i class="calibre4"> some</i> undesirable behavior patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But people must be educated as to the difference between traits that are likely to be spontaneously outgrown and those that are not. Surely chronic social isolation, passivity and unpopularity are traits which are not likely to be spontaneously outgrown. Indeed, such traits can only become worse as their manifestation invites bullying, rejection and ignoring from peers; and peers are <i class="calibre4"> crucial</i> agents in the socialization process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another widespread trait among the mothers of very loveshy males is <i class="calibre4"> two-facedness. </i> Many of the most severely loveshy men complained that their mothers could become totally transformed upon such occasions as the ringing of a telephone or the buzzing of a doorbell. Consider the following remark that was made by a 42-year old loveshy man:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"There were some scenes you just wouldn't believe. My mother would be screaming and hollaring and wailing at me that she wished I was dead and that I'd get hit by a car and all that. She'd be throwing glassware and books at me and yelling so loud that the neighbors at the other end of the block could hear. Then the doorbell would ring. My mother would open the door, and if it was a friend of hers she'd suddenly become a totally different person. I mean she would start laughing, and she would lovingly invite the friend in and be incredibly nice to her. This happened so many times when I was growing up. And each time I could just puke. I would just seethe inside because some of these friends of my mother would tell me how lucky I was to have such a wonderful mother. All these people would be telling me all the time that my mother was just the nicest, warmest, most generous person they knew, and that I was really lucky. If I could have only told them what a vicious, poison-tongued bitch she always was, I know they'd never have believed me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, you cannot tell a book by its cover. Many of these mothers were viewed by their sons as being extremely status-conscious and oriented towards creating a good impression irrespective of whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>1 6 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychoemotional consequences might be involved. Deeply insecure at heart, these women simply could not permit any unpolished side of themselves to be displayed to the public. This may be one reason why (1) they would not accept therapeutic help for their pre-love-shy sons, and (2) they did not, deep down in their hearts, really like, love, or respect their sons very much—even though they would often loudly and angrily protest to the contrary. (These mothers would often remind their sons of how "lucky" they were to have such a mother as themselves!) In sum, throughout his formative years the chronically loveshy adult male had behaved in ways which with today's knowledge would have made it very easy for him to have been singled out. Simply put, <i class="calibre4">chronic, pathological loveshyness can be detected in advance. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unless laws can be passed that would assure all children the right to appropriate therapy irrespective of the wishes of weak-egoed, insecure parents, preventive measures might continue to be well nigh impossible to take. Appropriate preventive efforts would certainly entail:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) individual and group therapy for the children themselves; (2) occasional injections of appropriate amounts of testosterone; (3) twice weekly individual and group therapy sessions for the parents of shy boys, and particularly for the mothers; (4) <i class="calibre4"> required</i> attendance by parents at "Parent-Effectiveness Training"</p>
<p class="calibre1">seminars operated in accordance with the well-tested and proven principles of Dr. Thomas Gordon. (See bibliography of this volume for Gordon's relevant works. See also the ONE MINUTE</p>

<p class="calibre1">1. Injections of <i class="calibre4"> anti-anxiety</i> drugs with few or no side effects <i class="calibre4"> such as nardil</i> (see the discussion in chapter 2, page 67), might also prove extremely helpful if these are begun on afflicted boys in early elementary school or even during the preschool years. See especially Dr. David V. Sheehan's book THE ANXIETY DISEASE. The earlier in life such anti-anxiety drugs are administered, the greater the probability of completely staving off loveshyness and social isolation/unpopularity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Medical researchers should test the hypothesis that the mothers of pathologically shy males have an unusually low blood progesterone level <i class="calibre4"> all the time, </i> and not merely at or before menstruation. If such an hypothesis is borne out, it would partially explain why the loveshys' mothers had such a difficult time holding a pregnancy and giving birth to healthy children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>Chapter 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Family Composition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the premises upon which this book is based is that it is possible to learn a great deal about the underlying causes of loveshyness by contrasting the backgrounds of men who are severely affected by it with the backgrounds of men who are not affected. For example, if a characteristic is very prevalent in the backgrounds of the self-confident, non-shy men, but very rare in the backgrounds of those who are loveshy, we might reasonably deduce that the absence of that characteristic <i class="calibre4">may</i> have some bearing upon the development of loveshyness. Contrariwise, if a characteristic is found to be very commonplace among the loveshys and rare among the non-shys, we might similarly deduce that the characteristic <i class="calibre4"> might</i> have something to do with the development of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No characteristic or experience could,  <i class="calibre4"> by itself, </i> cause severe loveshyness to develop. However, with a certain number of the wrong characteristics or experiences prevalent in a person's background, severe and intractable loveshyness might be deemed quite likely to develop and to remain dominant over a person's life. Experiences and characteristics add up <i class="calibre4"> not</i> in a mechanical way, but in a cumulative, synergistic, "chemical" kind of way. In essence, with the right complex of deleterious factors in a person's background, seriously debilitating loveshyness is highly likely to eventuate.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Brothers and Sisters</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the 500 men studied was asked to indicate the number of brothers and sisters that he had. In addition, each man was asked to indicate the current ages of each one of his brothers and sisters along with his own current age. Normally this type of questions does not yield particularly interesting findings. And indeed as far as <i class="calibre4"> brothers</i> were concerned I not surprisingly found that there were no meaningful differences at all between the loveshy men and the non-shy men. In essence, 161</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>162 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loveshy men were no less likely than the non-shys to have grown up with a brother around. Moreover, the experience of having an older or younger brother was about equally prevalent in the backgrounds of both the loveshys and the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> large differences</i> were found between the loveshys and the non-shys as far as the experience of having had a <i class="calibre4"> sister</i> was concerned. Only 14 percent of the self-confident, non-shy men had <i class="calibre4">not</i> grown up with a sister around. In contrast, fully 59 percent of the university-aged loveshy men had grown up without having had a sister around. And a full 71 percent <i class="calibre4"> (almost three out of every four) of the older</i> <i class="calibre4">loveshy men had never had a sister. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">On the other hand, fully 51 percent of the self-confident, non-shy males</i> <i class="calibre4">had grown up with two or more sisters, </i> compared to only 6 percent of the younger loveshy men, and <i class="calibre4"> just 3 percent</i> of the older loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An interesting statistical point is of relevance here. American government statistics indicate that approximately one-third of all boys in the United States grow up without a sister. The <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> men studied for this book were, as per the discussion in chapter five, more self-confident and non-shy than the average or typical young man. In essence, as a group they were blessed with an above-average level of self-confidence vis-a-vis the opposite sex. And this may be a reflection of the fact that only 14 percent of them grew up without having a sister around, compared to approximately 34 percent of American men generally, and a full 71 percent of the most severely loveshy older men who were studied for this book. (Again, 59 percent of the younger loveshys did not have a sister.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus we can readily surmise that the experience of having a sister might well have had something important to do with helping to develop masculine self-confidence with women. Indeed, this suggestion becomes all the more potent when it is noted that 51 percent of the very self-confident men had two or more sisters, compared to only 6 percent and 3 percent of the two very loveshy groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mode of Standardization</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a well supported (by research evidence) theorem in sociology called the "mode of standardization". Simply put, this theorem stipulates that: the more frequently two different kinds of groups interact with each other (provided that the interaction is not brought about by coercion), the better able to understand and to appreciate each other those two different kinds of people or groups are likely to become. In essence, frequent interaction leads to mutual understanding, liking and loving. Moreover, it also leads to a gradual and ever increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>Family Composition 163</p>
<p class="calibre1">concordance of attitudes, values, beliefs, hopes, desires, aspirations, and dreams between the two different kinds of people or groups. In short, through frequently interacting, people gradually come to think pretty much alike and also to like and even to love as well as to understand one another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Years of interviewing very shy men have convinced me that loveshys do not understand women very well at the gut emotional (as opposed to intellectual) level. And what people do not understand they tend to fear. For men with sisters, interacting with females who are in their own age group tends to remove much of the aura of mystery surrounding the female sex. More succinctly, through growing up with sisters around boys are accorded the valuable experience of frequently and directly interacting with female age-mates on a thoroughly informal basis. They are thus permitted to relate to girls as people who are little different from themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important too is the fact that sisters very often bring their friends home for after school play and for a myriad of recreational activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally adjusted boys similarly invite to their homes their own same-sexed friends. Thus, throughout their formative years youngsters who grow up in families with opposite-sexed siblings are at a clear advantage in that they are accorded the near-daily opportunity to meet and to informally socialize not only with their own opposite-sexed siblings, but also with the close friends of these siblings. During adolescense opposite-sexed siblings can provide an important pool of potential dating partners in the friends whom they invite to the home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when brothers do not date their sisters' friends, as is typically the case when the sister is older rather than younger than the brother, the presence of a sister still provides a growing boy with an unending series of valuable learning experiences. Thus, having a sister allows a boy to perceive girls as real people who can be approached, joked around with, argued with, and whose companionship can be enjoyed. Having a sister provides a man with a head start in being able to <i class="calibre4"> relax</i> emotionally around women. And the ability to relax and feel comfortable when around women is the first step towards bypassing or overcoming the loveshyness problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In her 1976 book entitled DILEMMAS OF MASCULINITY, Mirra Komarovsky cited her own research evidence indicating that <i class="calibre4"> for young</i> <i class="calibre4">men</i> a history of good relations with <i class="calibre4"> sisters</i> was a far more important determinant of self-confidence in successful dating and courting of young women than was a history of good relations with brothers or even with mothers.1 My own data indicated that neither the quality of the brother-sister relationship nor whether the sister was the older or younger sibling, made anywhere nearly as much difference in terms of predicting a man's non-shyness in his informal relationships with women as did the mere</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>1 6 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact of his simply having a sister in the first place. Only very few of the men studied for this book had poor or strained relationships with their sisters. And whereas having a younger sister did yield a better payoff for the male than did having an older sister, my own data indicate that even an older sister is far better for a boy than not having any sister at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Interactions vis-a-vis Married People</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The "mode of standardization" theorem provides a good explanation as to why never married men usually find <i class="calibre4"> married</i> women considerably easier than never married women to talk with. And, of course, it is no secret that single, never married women typically find married men much easier and more pleasant to talk with than they find never married men to be. Married people are ordinarily used to talking on an intimate basis to people of the opposite sex. After all, they do it with their spouses every day. Thus they do not need to put on any kind of a defensive, sham act. Simply put, married people are less likely than single people to need the protective mask of a role or a script.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this natural ease which never married people feel when they are in conversation with married people often gives rise to problems. Secretaries who are otherwise quite conventional sometimes find themselves falling in love with their married bosses or job colleagues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such love relationships often create a great deal of emotional pain and suffering for everyone involved. And yet these same rather conventional women who take such delight in talking with married men (often to the point of getting themselves emotionally entangled) often behave in an annoyingly aloof and disinterested way vis-a-vis the available single, never married males prevalent within their social and work environments. Often the tragedy is that the never married man remains lonely while the never married woman allows herself to become severely hurt over an attached man whom she cannot possibly win. And the never married man remains much more socially inept than he otherwise would if he had the interested involvement of the woman who keeps spurning him in favor of the smooth-talking, non-shy already married man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite extreme and chronic loveshyness, most of the loveshy men interviewed for this book could recall instances wherein they had stumbled upon a conversation with a married woman who had been either in their own age range or younger. And virtually all of these loveshy men were amazed at how easily they could talk with these married women, and at how completely relaxed they had been made to feel by these women's attitude toward them. Many of these men recalled how frustrated and bitter they had felt upon learning that the woman was married or otherwise "taken". In fact, had she not been "taken", it is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>Family Composition 165</p>
<p class="calibre1">likely that at least some of these severely loveshy males could have developed a viable and potentially permanent relationship. My point, of course, is that young women who are spontaneous and open, without any pretenses, are much easier for loveshy men to open up with than are single, never married women who feel constrained to play a role.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result of being unused to interacting with male age-mates on an open, honest, and casual basis, the never married woman in her role playing and mask wearing diffidence erects barriers to free-flowing conversation that are every bit as real and impenetrable as the barriers which the loveshy male erects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the questions to which each of the men in this study responded reflects these problems very poignantly. I asked each man to react to this statement: "It seems that whenever I develop a crush on someone I soon find out that the person is already taken." And 100</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys fully agreed with this statement together with 86 percent of the younger (university aged) loveshys. In contrast, only 20 percent of the self-confident non-shy men saw fit to agree with this statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In having had a good deal of experience at interacting with women <i class="calibre4">(including sisters)</i> throughout their lives, the non-shy men seemed to enjoy a relatively easy facility at penetrating the coolness and aloofness barriers that are commonplace among never married women in our culture. Perhaps the non-shys' calm self-confidence and suave, nonthreatening bearing assured them of being perceived in much the same way that single women usually perceive married men. Then too, it seems probable that the competitive nature of the non-shys served to render them difficult to discourage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the loveshy males, on the other hand, the disinterested airs of single girls cause feelings of fear, anxiety and discouragement. Lacking past experiences with sisters and with other young women, the loveshy take life too seriously. And they are thus unable to roll with the punches and sustain a creative, happy sense of humor about the foibles of human nature—as these foibles affect heterosexual interaction and the various sham acts and pretenses that both genders tend to use on one another.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications for Prevention</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, it is not possible to assure every boy of growing up in a family which contains a sister. (See the chapter titled "Parenthood Aspirations" for a scientific technique that can allow parents to choose in advance the genders of their future children with up to 85 percent accuracy.) However, there are certain things which parents and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>166 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">elementary school officials <i class="calibre4"> can do</i> right now to provide sisterless boys (particularly the socially isolated and withdrawn) with a viable alternative to the experience of having a sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would recommend the development of a new children's recreational organization to be called the <i class="calibre4"> "Coed Scouts". </i> For many decades such organizations as the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Cub Scouts, Boys Club of America, Brownies, Campfire Girls, YMCA and YWCA, have done big business. But these organizations have all traditionally segregated children according to gender. I believe that this traditional practice is counterproductive in our contemporary quite <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> world. And this is particularly true as far as socially isolated, shy and inhibited young boys are concerned. Satisfactory adjustment in adulthood absolutely requires an ability to get along smoothly and harmoniously with <i class="calibre4"> both</i> genders. Boys who are shy and withdrawn vis-a-vis their own gender at the elementary school level are almost always afflicted with incipient loveshyness. Thus there can be no question but that such boys would benefit enormously from membership in an organization comprised of equal numbers of girls and boys which entails weekly recreational activities, and which makes it both very easy and very pleasant for the two genders to interact socially.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the time children reach the age of two, American parents begin taking steps to encourage their children to play in gender-segregated peer groups, and to develop friendships exclusively with individuals of their own gender. Yet research evidence has shown that young children do not <i class="calibre4"> naturally</i> ("instinctually") gravitate towards gender-segregated peer groups. If left entirely to their own devices a majority of children in fact choose to play in coeducational peer groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that the easy availability to all children of a coeducational peer group would represent an extremely useful preventive device for nipping heterosexual loveshyness in the bud. The little boy who will eventually develop into a young man so severely shy with girls that he cannot date or marry <i class="calibre4"> can easily be spotted</i> in kindergarten and in the first grade. And inasmuch as he <i class="calibre4"> can</i> be readily spotted, failure to take positive action to stem the tide of his ever worsening loveshyness is both unnecessary, unethical, and immoral. The very shy man is of little use to himself or to his society and community. Failure to take action where it is warrented is tantamount to discarding valuable human resources.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Only Child</p>
<p class="calibre1">The status of being an "only child" was a great deal more common among the ranks of the loveshy men than it was among the self-confident, non-shy respondents. Only <i class="calibre4"> seven percent</i> of the non-shy men had grown</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>Family Composition 167</p>
<p class="calibre1">up as only children. In contrast, 25 percent of the younger (university aged) loveshys and 31 percent of the older loveshy men had grown up as only children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A note of caution is in order here. The vast majority of research studies in both psychology and in child development that have looked at only children have found them to be <i class="calibre4"> better adjusted</i> than children with siblings. Indeed, this is especially true for only male children. Boys without any brothers and sisters <i class="calibre4"> normally</i> enjoy significantly higher levels of self-esteem and social self-confidence than do the large majority of boys with brothers and sisters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So how come <i class="calibre4"> this</i> research study revealed a strong relationship between only child status and severe loveshyness? My suspicion is that the experience of growing up an only child serves to increase the chances of extreme shyness <i class="calibre4"> if and only if</i> incompetent parenting and inhibition genes are involved. It is quite probable that most people who have only children turn out to be at least slightly <i class="calibre4"> above</i> average in parental competence. In contrast, the data collected for this book strongly suggest that severely loveshy males tend to have had a history of less than adequate parenting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, for those with parents of normal effectiveness growing up an only child can be an advantage. However, when the mother and the father are less than adequately competent, the only child with the inhibition gene is left with no one around to mitigate the psychoemotional blows that often come to pass. When brothers and/or sisters are around they will usually incur at least some of the parents' wrath and bizarre behavior. And even though many families with more than one child do make a scapegoat out of one specific individual, siblings very often do protect one another to at least some extent from the behavior of hostile, capricious and bizarre parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With virtually no exceptions, all of the loveshy men I studied who had grown up as only children recounted a large number of bizarre, erratic and capricious incidents perpetrated by their parents, and particularly by their mothers. Words like "irascible", "abrasive", "truculent", "tense", "high strung", "cantankerous", and "petulent", were typically used by this group to describe their mothers. Even now as adults, virtually none of these only children seemed to like their mothers to any extent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' mothers seemed to have conveyed an extremely frightening and obnoxious image of womanhood—an image that is anything but attractive or alluring. For those who grew up as only children this type of obnoxious behavior had to be dealt with alone and without any help from anyone. Many of the men I interviewed had learned to accept their mother's behavior on an intellectual level. On an emotional level, however, virtually none of these loveshy men had made any</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>168 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">headway at all in coming to grips with commonplace events of their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kinship Relationships</p>
<p class="calibre1">In traditional societies men and women were seldom left entirely to their own devices in rearing children. If a mother or a father happened to be under great stress or for some other reason could not properly care for their child, a relative such as an aunt or an uncle would take over for a time. In fact, even in the contemporary United States most families seem to be enmeshed in a kinship network which provides a considerable amount of help on occasions when things become a little too tough. Recent studies on child abuse have documented the fact that abusers tend to be far more isolated from relatives, kin, and chosen friends, than nonabusive parents. Men who beat their wives similarly tend to be isolated, as do their victimized wives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly, it seemed appropriate to ask both the shy and the non-shy men some questions about the extent to which there might have been other adult relatives around, besides their parents, upon whom they could have depended for emotional support as they were growing up. One of the questions I asked required each respondent to react to the following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was growing up I had at least 3 or 4 other adult relatives besides my parents to whom I could turn for help and emotional support."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The results were remarkable, and convey a strong suggestion that emotional support networks among relatives and kin serve to enhance children's capacities to cope effectively with stress and to deal competently and self-confidently with the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Zero percent</i> of the older loveshy men indicated that the above statement was <i class="calibre4"> true</i> for them. Only 9 percent of the younger loveshy men indicated that it was true, whereas an impressive 59 percent of the self-confident non-shy men indicated that it was true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Respondents were given the opportunity to check that this statement was "very untrue" for them, or merely "untrue". The dramatic differences between the three groups of men become accentuated when it is observed that 94 percent of the older loveshys indicated that the statement was "very untrue" for them, compared to 71 percent of the younger loveshy men, and only 13 percent of the self-confident non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>Family Composition 169</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each respondent was further asked to indicate just exactly <i class="calibre4"> how many</i> relatives (other than parents) he had had available for help and emotional support during his formative years as a child and teenager. Fully 53</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shy men indicated that they had had three or more relatives to count on. Only 8 percent of the younger loveshy men and <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> of the older loveshy men were able to indicate that while growing up they could count on three or more adult relatives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, 87 percent of the older loveshy men said that there had been <i class="calibre4"> no</i> relatives they could have counted upon as a child for help or emotional support. The analogous figures for the loveshy and non-shy university males were 68 percent and 27 percent respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As for <i class="calibre4"> the present time, </i> fully all 100 percent of the older loveshys and 71 percent of the younger loveshys agreed that <i class="calibre4"> "there is no one 1</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">can turn to". </i> Zero percent (nobody) of the non-shys agreed with that statement and sentiment.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Quality of Parents' Marriages</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is evidence that the loveshys' parents had somewhat less satisfying marriages than did the parents of the non-shys. However, the issue of divorce versus non-divorce did not differentiate between the three groups of parents. In other words, the loveshys' parents were no more likely than the non-shys' parents to have ever divorced or separated. For example, 20 percent of the non-shys' parents had either divorced or separated. The analogous figure for the older loveshys was 17 percent, and for the younger loveshys it was 23 percent. Looking at divorce alone (excluding separation), only 6 percent of the older loveshys' parents had been divorced. Eight percent of the younger loveshys' parents had divorced. And just 7 percent of the non-shys' parents had been divorced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I asked another question which may constitute a better barometer of marital quality than the issue of divorce/separation itself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man: "If your parents were not divorced, about how happy would you rate the quality of their marriage?"  <i class="calibre4"> Excluding</i> those men whose parents had actually been divorced, fully 45 percent of the older loveshys and 41 percent of the young loveshys classified their parents'</p>
<p class="calibre1">marriages as having been "not too happy" or "unhappy". Among the non-shy men, 31 percent classified their parents' marriages this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another question I asked: "Did your parents get along with each other during your childhood, or was there conflict, fighting, and dissatisfaction?" And here only 6 percent of the non-shy men indicated that their parents had gotten along with each other <i class="calibre4"> less than moderately</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>170 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">well. </i> In contrast, fully 36 percent of the older loveshy men together with 31 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that their parents had gotten along with each other <i class="calibre4"> less than moderately well. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each man: "While you were growing up, about how often did your father praise your mother?" And only 12 percent of the non-shys responded "rarely or never", compared to 30 percent of the young loveshys and 35 percent of the older ones. This question may have some implications in terms of <i class="calibre4"> modeling. </i> Most sons, including even those who do not get along very well with their fathers, model their own behavior to some extent after that of their fathers. The loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">inability to relate to young women in a positive way may be partially attributable to deficits in the ways in which their own fathers had failed to openly model this behavior vis-a-vis their mothers. Of course, as so much evidence presented in this book indicates, most of the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">mothers had been far from charming or attractive. And perhaps their objective qualities and characteristics had done little to inspire praise or admiration from husbands or sons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, praise had not flown in a particularly generous fashion in the reverse direction either. I asked each man: "While you were growing up, about how often did your mother praise your father?" And only 6 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> men indicated "rarely or hardly ever". In contrast, fully 28 percent of the young loveshys and 33 percent of the older loveshys said "rarely or hardly ever".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, it would appear that the loveshys' parents had had significantly less emotionally satisfying marriages than those of the non-shy men. And this had doubtless been reflected in the ways these parents had openly comported themselves vis-a-vis each other around the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it also appears that the loveshys' parents had had some aversion to the divorce option. Perhaps there had been an unhealthy, symbiotic dependency between the husbands and the wives in many of these marriages. In other words, frequent turmoil and tension may have been perceived by many of these people as less threatening and less distressing than the idea of divorce or permanent separation. In essence, a tension-filled relationship may have been viewed as preferable to the absence of any close primary relationship at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Conclusions</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most commonplace family composition among <i class="calibre4"> both</i> severely loveshy groups was a pair of parents with an intact marriage, and one or two brothers and <i class="calibre4"> no</i> sisters. The research data obtained for this book clearly suggest that severe loveshyness is strongly associated with the</p>

<p class="calibre1">experience of having grown up in a family without female siblings. "Only child" status was also found to be associated with severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was pointed out that "only children"  <i class="calibre4"> with competent parents</i> are probably at even less risk of developing severe loveshyness than children (of competent parents) who do have siblings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, severe loveshyness appears to be strongly associated with growing up in a family which does not afford any adult relatives or kin, <i class="calibre4">other than parents, </i> upon whom a child can count for emotional support and help. Simply put, the families of the loveshys were much more isolated from relatives and kin, than were the families of the non-shy men. Further, the little kin interaction which the loveshys had experienced throughout their formative years tended to have been much</p>
<p class="calibre1">"cooler" and less emotionally satisfying than that which had been experienced by the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interactions with siblings and with adult relatives and kinfolk can do much to absorb a considerable amount of the stress and turbulence created by emotionally disordered parental behavior. In most cases the loveshys did not have such benefits available to them. On the other hand, most of them did grow up in intact homes. The parents of the loveshys were no more likely than those of the non-shy men to have ever divorced or separated. However, the <i class="calibre4"> emotional quality</i> of the marriages of the loveshys' parents appears in most cases to have been markedly inferior to that prevalent in the marriages of the non-shys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Parents as a Cause of Love-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Shyness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1979, sociologists Boyd C. Rollins and Darwin L. Thomas published an important article which reviewed hundreds of research studies pertinent to the relationship between family atmosphere, and passive, socially reticent behavior. I want to underscore that the following statements reflect the quite consistent research results of <i class="calibre4"> hundreds of studies</i> in the social and behavioral sciences. In fact, the propositions which appear below have become an integral part of what is now considered to be <i class="calibre4"> valid knowledge. </i> I present these propositions here because they anticipate very nicely and with remarkable accuracy the findings at which I arrived after years of interviewing and studying severely loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, most of my own findings of pertinence to maternal and paternal behavior can be subsumed under one or another of the following propositions:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i>  # 1 : The greater the amount of warm, emotional supportiveness that is displayed by parents towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">their children, the greater the amount of <i class="calibre4"> social competence</i> that will eventually be developed and displayed by those children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #2: The greater the amount of use that parents make of <i class="calibre4"> verbal reasoning</i> in the disciplining of their children, the greater the amount of social competence</p>
<p class="calibre1">that will eventually be developed and displayed by those children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #3: The greater the amount and use that parents make of physical coercion in their attempts to influence and control their children, the <i class="calibre4"> LESS social competence</i> those children will eventually develop and display.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #4: The greater the amount of warm, emotional supportiveness that is displayed by parents towards</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>174 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">their children, the fewer the behavior problems <i class="calibre4"> (of</i> <i class="calibre4">which shyness is one)</i> that those children will develop and display.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #5: The greater the incidence of parental coercion (use of force), the greater the behavior problems in</p>
<p class="calibre1">children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #6: The more parents try to control the behavior of their children, the greater the likelihood that behavior problems will develop.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #7: The greater the parental coercion, the lower the self-esteem and self-confidence of children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #8: The greater the amount of warm, emotional supportiveness that is displayed by parents towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">their children, the higher the level of self-esteem and self-confidence that will be developed and displayed by those children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #9: The greater the amount of use that parents make of <i class="calibre4"> verbal reasoning</i> in the disciplining of their children, the greater the amount of self-esteem and</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-confidence those children are likely to develop.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #10: The greater the parental supportiveness, the lower the incidence of schizophrenia in children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #11: The greater the parental coercion, the greater the incidence of schizophrenia in children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #12: For both boys and girls, the greater the coercive-ness <i class="calibre4"> of</i> the <i class="calibre4"> opposite sexed parent, </i> the less adequate will be the child's own-gender sex role orientation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, dominant, coercive mothers tend to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breed passive, feminized boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #13: The greater the relative dominance of the father over the mother, the stronger will be the masculine sex role orientation in boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #14: The greater the parental power of the <i class="calibre4"> same-sexed</i> <i class="calibre4">parent, </i> the greater the social competence of children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #15: The greater the coercive control attempts of parents, the greater the social incompetence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">children.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Proposition</i> #16: Fathers' emotional supportiveness is strongly associated with a healthy masculine sex role orientation in boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is worth repeating that each of the foregoing sixteen propositions has been well supported by hundreds of well executed research studies.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness  1 7 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">The research findings pertinent to severely loveshy men which I shall delineate on the remaining pages of this and the following chapter, all corroborate the validity of these propositions. Thus, these propositions are all well worth learning and using in the course of ordinary, day-today interaction vis-a-vis all of one's loved ones. To the extent that these propositions are learned and acted upon, to that extent the incidence of severe loveshyness in our society can be <i class="calibre4"> and will be</i> enormously reduced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Children are exposed to the large majority of their most influential learning experiences in just two places: (1) the family, and (2) the peer group. Chapter 10 will focus upon the latter. This chapter and the following one will examine the impact which parents have upon the development of severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Family Atmosphere</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The general atmosphere of the family in which a child grows up exerts a cumulative impact upon his view of the world and of himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous questions regarding family atmosphere were included in the questionnaire. And the findings tended to sharply and consistently differentiate the loveshys from the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked each man: "Compared to most people, about how happy would you say your family life was during your childhood years?" And fully 89 percent of the non-shys indicated that it had been either "very happy" or "happy". In contrast, this was true for only 31</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys and for a mere 19 percent of the older loveshys. In fact, the loveshys differed from the non-shys even more sharply regarding how happy they felt their family lives had been during their <i class="calibre4"> teenaged years. </i> Fully 82 percent of the non-shys rated their family lives as having been either "very happy" or "happy" during their teenaged years. Only 22 percent of the younger loveshys together with a mere 14 percent of the older loveshys rated their family lives as having been this happy during their teenaged years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, questions such as these are fundamentally subjective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And some readers may feel that loveshys are "pathological complainers". However, people are governed to a far greater extent by what they subjectively believe to have been the case than by what the objective state of affairs might have been. When the obtained differences to a subjective question are as great as those which obtained here, I think it is reasonable to infer significance for the etiology of loveshyness. If the loveshy are indeed "pathological complainers", we need to concern ourselves with the question of how they got to be that way in the first place. The process of becoming a "pathological complainer" may not be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>176 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">too different from that which is involved in becoming severely loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, there is a <i class="calibre4"> social desirability</i> element to many of the questions to be dealt with in this chapter. Most people tend to exaggerate the extent of their past family happiness. The tendency of most people to adjudge happiness in a positive direction renders the loveshys' pattern of negative responses all the more impressive and noteworthy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Extent of Family Emotional Supportiveness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man: "To what extent did you feel that your parents believed in you and supported you emotionally?" And 67 percent of the non-shy men answered "a great deal", compared to only 32 percent of the younger loveshys and 23 percent of the older ones. Contrariwise, 58 percent of the older loveshy men felt that their parents had provided them with very little if any emotional support. Among the younger loveshys 48 percent felt that they had received very little if any emotional support, compared to a mere 13 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meaningful participation by children in dinner table conversation has been found by a good many researchers to correlate highly with active participation throughout adulthood in community and political affairs. Thus, I asked each respondent how frequently he had been able to participate meaningfully in dinner table conversation during his formative years in his parents' home. The obtained differences between the loveshys and the non-shys were quite substantial on this question. For example, 80 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> men indicated that their participation in dinner table conversations had been "frequent" or "very frequent", compared to only 36 percent of the younger loveshys and just 23 percent of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, it cannot be considered surprising that rather substantial differences obtained between the three groups with regard to reactions to this statement: "I always felt free and comfortable about discussing my problems with my parents." In one sense this might be considered a poor item because virtually no child is very likely to <i class="calibre4"> "always" </i> feel free and comfortable about talking with parents. Nevertheless, 52 percent of the non-shys indicated that the statement was "true" for them. Only 17</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys together with just 10 percent of the older loveshys felt the same way. Indeed, 66 percent of the older loveshys and 57 percent of the younger ones felt that the statement was definitely "untrue". Only 19 percent of the non-shys felt that it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">"untrue".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' parents evidently had not acted particularly interested in what their sons had had to say. I asked each respondent: "As</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 1 <i class="calibre4">77</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">far as you can tell, how interested were your parents and other family members in what you had to say?" Fully 52 percent of the older loveshys together with 45 percent of the younger ones responded that their parents had been either "not too interested" or "not interested", compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys. In fact, 74 percent of the non-shy men indicated that their parents had been either "very interested" or "interested". Only 27 percent of the older loveshy men and 34 percent of the younger ones felt that their parents had been "very interested" or "interested" in what they had had to say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And when I asked: "How frequently did you enjoy informal conversations with your mother about any topic?" only 5 percent of the non-shy men indicated "infrequently". In contrast, 58 percent of the older loveshys together with 46 percent of the younger ones indicated that they had enjoyed such conversations on an "infrequent" basis. The findings when this same question was asked with regard to <i class="calibre4"> fathers</i> were quite similar. Fully 43 percent of the older loveshys along with 37 percent of the younger ones indicated that they had enjoyed informal conversations with their fathers on an "infrequent" basis. The analogous percent for the non-shy men was <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> (nobody).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another question pertinent to parental emotional supportiveness which clearly differentiated the three different groups of respondents was: "When you received a low grade at school on a test or paper, did you feel free and comfortable about discussing the matter with your mother?" Fully 65 percent of the non-shy men indicated the affirmative, compared to only 39 percent of the younger loveshys, and just 32 percent of the older loveshys. In fact, several of the loveshy men spontaneously mentioned that for them to have approached their mothers about a poor performance on a paper at school would really have constituted a case of "double jeopardy". In essence, they could have looked forward to the very antithesis of "emotional supportiveness" from their mothers in this type of situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably the most "telltale" item in this set was the statement: "My mother sometimes acted as though I didn't exist." Fully 43 percent of the older loveshy men and 35 percent of the younger loveshys indicated "yes" to this statement, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked the same question with regard to the fathers, and was somewhat surprised to find a somewhat less pathological set of responses than I had found with regard to the mothers. Only 30 percent of the older loveshys felt that their fathers had sometimes acted as though they (the loveshys) did not exist. The analogous percentage for the younger loveshys was 22 percent. Again, none of the non-shys felt that their fathers had ever ignored their existence.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>178 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Komarovsky Study</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The 1976 Mirra Komarovsky study titled DILEMMAS OF MASCULINITY compared and contrasted the personalities and family backgrounds of virginal and non-virginal Columbia University men. Only a fourth of the undergraduate men in her study were virginal, and she found them to have had significantly lower self-images together with much weaker self-ratings for self-confidence, than had been the case for the sexually experienced men. Moreover, 73 percent of the virginal men fell below the mean for university students on the <i class="calibre4"> sociability</i> factor; only 29 percent of the non-virgins similarly fell below the mean on sociability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, 47 percent of her virginal men fell below average on the <i class="calibre4"> self-acceptance</i> factor, compared to only 2 percent of the non-virginal men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, most of Komarovsky's virginal men <i class="calibre4"> were</i> dating at least occasionally; and a substantial minority of them gave "moral-religious"</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons for not having experienced premarital coitus. Thus as a group Komarovsky's virgins cannot be considered equivalent to the pathologically loveshy men upon whom this book is intended to focus. Nevertheless, Komarovsky's personality profiles for the virginal men are certainly of very much the same sort as the personality profiles for the loveshys of the current study.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With this in mind, it is interesting that Komarovsky found <i class="calibre4"> fathers</i> to have been more important than mothers in differentiating the virginal men from those who had had sexual experience with a girlfriend. For example, only 42 percent of the virgins had rated their relationships with their fathers as having been favorable. Among the non-virgins, on the other hand, 62 percent rated their relationships with their fathers as having been favorable. In contrast, just under four-fifths of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> groups rated their relationships with their <i class="calibre4"> mothers</i> as having been favorable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"The virgins reported less satisfactory relationships with their fathers than the non-virgins did  . . . . The tests portrayed the virgins as deficient in self-esteem relative to the sexually experienced seniors</p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . . It is likely that an unfavorable self-image would drain the son's confidence to take the initiative in sexual advances to women. Thus, we can conclude that unfavorable father-son relationships tended to be associated with virginity by lowering the self-esteem and self-confidence of the son." (Komarovsky, 1976, p. 243.) Komarovsky's findings are quite interesting inasmuch as my own data seem to lead to a very different conclusion. In most cases, according to my own data, pathologically loveshy men appear to have had <i class="calibre4"> considerably worse</i> relationships with their mothers than with their fathers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, for many of these men the mother-son relationship had been so extremely bad as well as bizarre that "maternal" behavior may have served as a major factor precipitating severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness  1 7 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">One young man seemed to have arrived at quite a bit of insight regarding this matter:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I realize now that my mother probably couldn't help doing a lot of the things that she did. But I mean an eight year old kid doesn't really have an intellect yet. And all this stuff from my mother I'm sure had a cumulative impact on me that the intellect I have now just hasn't been able to fend off. I mean, all that stuff affects you more at the gut level. And I think that's what lasts. Your intellect can't fight off all the things that had been programmed into your gut throughout all the years of growing up." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the loveshys' relationships with their fathers had similarly been far from ideal. However, most of the men had been able to communicate at least a little bit with their fathers. And very few of the father-son relationships seemed to contain the bizarre elements that had been quite prevalent in the mother-son relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Family Democracy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The issue of family democracy is obviously quite closely related to the matter of how open, spontaneous, and unfettered by defensiveness family communication had been. A democratic family environment is one wherein children continually play an active role in the making and revising of all the rules, regulations and policies that impact upon them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is an environment characterized by high levels of mutual respect and mutual trust. The parents in such families both respect and trust their children because they know that genuine respect inspires respect, that trust inspires trust, and that love breeds love. Such parents intuitively realize that it is always the superordinate figure (i.e., the parent) who must make the first move towards inspiring <i class="calibre4"> (by their actions)</i> respect, love, trust, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> And such parents realize the prime importance of open, honest, nonthreatening communication that is unfettered by any ambiance of defensiveness or fear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In looking over the research literature on this subject I realized its relevancy to the loveshyness problem. For example, Robert Lane of Yale University, found that children who had taken an active part in dinner table conversations throughout the years of growing up tended to be far more likely as adults to vote and to take an active part in community affairs. Psychologist Kurt Lewin similarly accumulated strong and consistent evidence indicating that democratically managed families breed young people who are highly self-reliant, responsible, self-disciplined, goal oriented, and socially involved. Shy people have long</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>180 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">been known to cringe at the thought of self-disclosure. Unlike non-shys, loveshy people tend to be unable and unwilling to share their deepest thoughts and feelings with others. Keeping to themselves almost all the time, they tend to be uninvolved both socially and politically.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two of the questionnaire items that were incorporated into this study have a direct bearing upon the family democracy issue. Specifically, I asked each respondent: "While you were growing up, did you have any influence over the making and the revising of family rules and policies that affected you?" The respondents could check any one of four different options: (1) yes, much; (2) yes, some; (3) yes, little; and (4) none.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, fully 82 percent of the older loveshy men together with 69 percent of the younger loveshys had <i class="calibre4"> "little or no" </i> influence over the way in which their families had been managed. In stark contrast, only 26 percent of the non-shy men similarly indicated that they had had</p>
<p class="calibre1">"little or no" influence. Putting it another way, 74 percent of the non-shys had had either "much" or "some" influence over the ways their families had been managed. This had been true for only 18 percent of the older loveshys and for 31 percent of the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, 52 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshys indicated that they had enjoyed <i class="calibre4"> no</i> influence at all over the way their families had been run.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 12 percent of the non-shys similarly indicated <i class="calibre4"> "no" </i> influence at all in regard to family management policies. Indeed, 36 percent of the non-shys indicated that they had had <i class="calibre4"> "much" </i> influence in the daily process of family management. Only 4 percent of the older loveshys and 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys similarly felt that they had had <i class="calibre4"> "much" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">influence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second question was asked much later on in the interview.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was done to assure overall reliability and validity of the research findings. The second item simply asked each man to react to this statement: "While I was growing up, even though I was a child I usually had a meaningful role in the way our family was run." Fully 73 percent of the non-shy men answered "true" to this statement, compared to only 34 percent of the younger loveshys and 27 percent of the older ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mutual Sensitivity to Needs and Feelings</p>
<p class="calibre1">An increasing number of social scientists are beginning to define</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"love" </i> as <i class="calibre4"> the communication of a compassionate mutual sensitivity to one another's needs and feelings. </i> In order for a person to reap the benefits of love he or she must first <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> loved. The data obtained for this book very clearly indicate that the parents (and <i class="calibre4"> particularly the mothers)</i> of the loveshy (1) did little to make their sons <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> loved, and (2) had very little if</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 181</p>
<p class="calibre1">any awareness or insight into the way in which their behavior was impacting upon their sons' psychoemotional development.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, she had the radio or the television on all the time. If I came in the room where she was she'd scream at me that she was trying to concentrate. Even during meal times she would have the radio on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can remember throughout all my school years how my mother and my father would both clobber me if I opened my mouth while we were eating dinner. They wanted to concentrate on what some news commentator was saying. But when I grew older it would be the same old story, even if the program was some stupid contest show or soap opera. Everything was more important than I was. I guess at the time I didn't think of it that way. But as I grew older I began to realize that I was just a sort of distraction to my parents. I was never the main show, or even the cartoon for that matter—ha, ha, ha!" (24-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshys' mothers undoubtedly believed that they truly loved their sons. In fact, many of these mothers frequently <i class="calibre4"> screamed</i> out that they "loved" their sons. And they sometimes shouted this with great rage!  <i class="calibre4"> But they didn't SHOW IT. </i> In essence, they would say one thing and do something which conveyed a very different message entirely.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such behaviors as forcing their sons to go to summer camp, and keeping the radio on at the dinner table instead of encouraging their sons to express themselves, illustrate well the crass insensitivity of the loveshys' parents. The emotional needs and feelings of the loveshys had mattered very little if at all. The loveshys' parents had been task oriented and "final results oriented", rather than person-oriented. They had been concerned about shaping and molding a son who would gain status and prestige for them in their local communities. In <i class="calibre4"> that</i> sense they had cared about their sons. They "cared" that their sons would be propitiously shaped and molded to fit their image of what a good son should be like. But they did not care much about their sons as people with deep feelings, emotions, and needs requiring recognition, respect, and emotional support.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an interesting paradox here. On one level many of the loveshys' parents had been quite generous. They gave their sons many material things, and often cried out in exasperated resignation about how "ungrateful" and "spoiled" their sons were. The following interview segment well illustrates this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, my parents were generous alright! The trouble is they were usually generous with the wrong things. Like even when I was a young kid my parents would constantly drag me into the best clothing stores. I was always the best dressed kid in town. They would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>182 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">constantly buy all these expensive outfits for me. But when I asked them to buy me a toy or a book or a record on the way home, they would complain about how spoiled I was; and they would threaten to beat the shit out of me if I didn't stop agitating them about a toy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were always very generous about getting me what I didn't particularly want or care about. But when it came to something I really did want the answer was always how spoiled and ungrateful I was, and why I didn't get the hell out and earn the money to buy it myself. The strange thing is—what they were buying me always cost a great deal more money than the things I really did want. And some of the things they bought I seldom even wore." (20-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The preoccupation which many of the love shys' parents had about clothing and appearance is well reflected in the response pattern to this questionnaire item: "Until I graduated from high school, my parents almost always decided what I would wear each day." Fully 33 percent of the older loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> agreed</i> with this statement, together with 22</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shy men agreed with it. In fact, one loveshy man spontaneously volunteered that every morning until the day he graduated from high school his father would come into his bedroom, drag him up, put his socks on for him, and then physically drag him into the bathroom where he (the father) would wash the son's face and remove in a sometimes painful manner any blackheads which had been apparent. And while the father did all this he would angrily rail and berate the son for being irresponsible and uncaring about being late for school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At one point in the questionnaire, I asked each man to react to the statement: "At Christmas when I was a child my parents almost always gave me too many clothes and not enough toys." And 38 percent of the older loveshy men along with 27 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4">agreed. </i> In contrast, only 12 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed with that statement. And in a similar item I asked for reactions to this statement: "My parents tried to wean me from stuffed animals, dolls, and other toys too early in life." Here again there were substantial differences between the loveshys and the non-shys. Fully 27 percent of the older loveshys along with 23 percent of the younger ones <i class="calibre4"> agreed</i> with this statement. Only 7 percent of the non-shy men agreed.</p>

<p class="calibre1">In his celebrated 1956 work entitled THE ART OF LOVING, social philosopher Erich Fromm distinguished between two types of "love": (1) <i class="calibre4"> milk, </i> and (2) <i class="calibre4"> honey. </i> The "milk" has to do with the provision of food,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 183</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing, shelter, as well as all the material luxeries. "Honey", on the other hand, has to do with conveying to the child a sense of deep personal worth, happiness, vibrancy—a feeling that life itself is intrinsically rich and highly worthwhile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When people are uncomfortable with life they often develop a grandiose preoccupation with <i class="calibre4"> appearance, </i> rather than with the <i class="calibre4"> human side</i> of interpersonal relationships. Highly tense and less-than-happy parents often shower their children with all manner of material goodies— <i class="calibre4">"milk",</i> to use Fromm's metaphorical term. When the recipients of all this "milk"</p>
<p class="calibre1">do not respond in the expected manner the parents are likely to angrily (and with <i class="calibre4"> hurt</i> feelings) accuse them of being "ungrateful", "spoiled",</p>
<p class="calibre1">"mean", "inconsiderate", <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Yet in spite of not securing the desired outcomes, these frustrated parents persist in showering their "ungrateful" child with more and more "milk". The vicious cycle repeats and repeats and repeats itself <i class="calibre4"> ad nauseum:</i> the parents give and the child does not respond favorably. The parents feel hurt and angry and accuse the child of being ungrateful and spoiled. And then the parents go on to commence showering their "ungrateful" child with some other form of expensive "milk".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, we must be clear on what the <i class="calibre4"> true culprit</i> is here. Moralists have characteristically made the mistake of blaming the excessive supply of "milk". Their advice has always been to stop showering the kid with so much milk because he doesn't appreciate it anyway. "And besides, you're only spoiling him rotten. The more you do for him, the less he appreciates," <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fallacy of the moralist's approach can be readily observed every day in the thousands of children from financially well-off homes who had always received a copious abundance of material goodies and who had never wanted for anything. Most of these children grow up very happy, exuberant, very sociable and socially well-skilled, well adjusted, self-disciplined, and genuinely loving of life <i class="calibre4"> and of the parents as well. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">How do such children get this way after having received such an excess abundance of "milk"? Many of such children receive brand new automobiles upon graduating high school, trips to Europe, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> And yet they turn out charming, love their parents, their parents are delighted with them, and most facets of their lives and of the lives of their parents function quite well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, it is NOT a matter of HOW MUCH "MILK" a child gets that makes the difference. A child can receive a surfeit of the material goodies, and still be a real joy both to himself/herself AND to his/her parents. More succinctly,  <i class="calibre4"> the thing that makes all the difference in the world</i> <i class="calibre4">is the presence of a significant amount of "honey" to accompany whatever amount</i> <i class="calibre4">of "milk" may be given. </i> AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF "MILK" CAN</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>184</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">NEVER BY ITSELF "SPOIL" A CHILD OR MAKE HIM/HER SEEM</p>
<p class="calibre1">UNGRATEFUL.  <i class="calibre4"> But ANY AMOUNT of "milk" given in the absence of a</i> <i class="calibre4">healthy amount of "honey" can and will "spoil" the child. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As Erich Fromm has convincingly argued,  <i class="calibre4"> both</i> "milk"  <i class="calibre4"> and</i> "honey"</p>
<p class="calibre1">are essential human needs. Some minimum amount of "milk" is a <i class="calibre4"> sine</i> <i class="calibre4">qua non</i> for mere survival. The paradox is that children who receive a very great deal of "milk" from their parents along with very little if any</p>
<p class="calibre1">"honey" are scarcely more than "just surviving". As adults they end up</p>
<p class="calibre1">"just existing". In the case of the loveshy, they just "hang on" with rather colorless and emotionally hollow lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A parent cannot compensate for deficits in the ability to disseminate</p>
<p class="calibre1">"honey" by going overboard in the dissemination of "milk". Many of the loveshys' parents had gone "overboard" in disseminating the "milk"</p>
<p class="calibre1">of huge wardrobes of clothing, material possessions, the best food, money, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Mystified and exasperated by their inability to "reach" their sons, these parents moved toward showering their loveshy sons with a lot of material goodies—as a substitute for the <i class="calibre4"> love</i> ("honey") which they did not know how to deliver. For these parents to simply have stopped showering their sons with material things would have very likely made matters even worse. The remedy does not lie in the increasing or in the decreasing of the amount of "milk" that is given. The remedy lies in somehow finding ways to teach highly serious, hypertense parents how to deliver "honey" to their children— the <i class="calibre4"> joie de vivre,</i> the vibrancy, the aliveness, the feeling of self-worth and self-pride, the unshakable feeling that life is beautiful and highly worthwhile despite the inevitable day-to-day problems and minor rejections.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Virtually hundreds of research studies have shown that if a parent is effective and naturally competent at providing the "honey" of life—</p>
<p class="calibre1">if the child really enjoys being in the company of his/her parents—the amount of influence the parents wield is very strong indeed. This is because the child has not erected any defensive barriers against the parents.  <i class="calibre4"> The most powerful social influence is always that which is least strongly</i> <i class="calibre4">perceived (felt) by those who are being influenced. </i> When there exists the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"honey" of genuine love between parents and children, there is inevitably a continuing flow of open,  <i class="calibre4"> unguarded</i> communication. No one is tense or on the defensive. No one has anything to hide. There is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">"lecturing" by parent to child. The child simply and quite automatically internalizes a majority of his parent's values without any awareness at all of the fact that he/she is so doing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, social influence is strongest when it is <i class="calibre4"> least noticed</i> by the one on the receiving end of the influence. And when the "honey" of spontaneous love suffuses a parent-child relationship it constitutes the most powerful form of fertilizer for strong albeit unfelt influence, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness  1 8 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the child coming to want to <i class="calibre4"> model</i> his/her behavior after that of the parent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot of all of this is that people cannot <i class="calibre4"> "own" </i> a child in the same way that they "own" a material possession. Children are independent souls who are in their parents' charge for a very brief time. The most successful parent-child relationships, like the most successful and happy husband-wife relationships, are those where there is a mutual facilitation of self-actualization, and where both (or all) parties to a relationship are accepted for themselves and <i class="calibre4"> are free to be themselves. </i> It is only when a person is accepted as he/she is that he/she becomes free to grow and to change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' parents could not accept their sons as <i class="calibre4"> their sons</i> <i class="calibre4">actually were. </i> The loveshys' parents were always trying to change their sons in some way. And they were quite serious in their efforts in this regard. They could not relax and enjoy their children—a key prerequisite for providing the necessary "honey". They could not <i class="calibre4"> "let go and let God",</i> to borrow a useful cliche from meditation experts. Moreover, any seemingly serious message eminating from the radio or television invariably commanded their attention to a far greater extent than their children's presence ever could.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Seriousness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the questions contained on the interview schedule have a strong bearing upon these points. For example, fully 67 percent of the older loveshy men agreed with the statement: "My parents were too serious with me." Among the younger loveshys 54 percent agreed. In contrast, only 19 percent of the non-shy men felt that their parents had been too serious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a similar question I asked for reactions to this statement: "My parents would almost constantly lecture to me about the way they wanted me to behave." Here again, 53 percent of the older loveshys together with 46 percent of the younger ones saw fit to agree with the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 27 percent of the non-shy men felt that their parents tended to constantly lecture them about how to behave.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In being too serious, the parents of the loveshy men never provided a role model for relaxed, informal, friendly interaction. Their children could not really relax and enjoy socializing within the family context.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead the loveshys learned throughout their formative years vis-a-vis their parents how to erect a defensive wall between themselves and other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>186 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inability to forgive and forget can also be seen as reflecting an overly tense, hyperserious attitude towards children and towards child-rearing responsibilities. Such parental attitudes can have a quite negative impact over time upon a child's developing self-image and his/her overall sense of self-worth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked for reactions to this statement: "My parents frequently remind me about and berate me for things they think I did wrong six, seven, or even eight or more years ago." And fully 45 percent of the older loveshy men responded in the <i class="calibre4"> affirmative. </i> Among the younger loveshys 35 percent indicated that the statement was true for themselves. But among the non-shy men, only 18 percent saw fit to agree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I asked: "My parents can't seem to forget things they think I did wrong a very long time ago, and they keep harping away about these things when I am around them and especially when they are angry." Here again, only 12 percent of the non-shy men responded in the affirmative. In contrast, 41 percent of the older loveshy men together with 34 percent of the younger ones indicated that the statement was <i class="calibre4"> true</i> for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A hyperserious attitude towards child-rearing combined with crass insensitivity towards a child's feelings can also be observed in issues pertinent to the invasion of privacy. The loveshys' parents were much more likely than the parents of the non-shys to feel that they <i class="calibre4"> owned</i> their children, and that anything which happened in their child's life was fully and completely <i class="calibre4"> their business. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, I sought reactions to this statement: "My <i class="calibre4"> mother</i> would sometimes use confidential, personal, or secret information about me to scold or belittle me, or to make fun of me." And fully 42 percent of the older loveshy men together with 33 percent of the younger ones said "yes". In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shy men indicated an affirmative response to this question.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I then asked each man the same question with respect to his <i class="calibre4"> father. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Strong differences continued to exist between the three research groups, although fathers were <i class="calibre4"> less likely</i> than mothers to have committed this sort of injustice against their sons. More specifically, 27 percent of the older loveshy men together with 20 percent of the younger ones recalled their fathers as having sometimes used confidential, personal information against them. The percent for the non-shy men was again <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> (nobody).</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another question, 46 percent of the older loveshys and 38 percent of the younger ones indicated that their mothers frequently failed to respect their privacy. Only 5 percent of the non-shy men felt the same way. In fact, 53 percent of the older loveshys and 43 percent of the younger ones agreed that: "My mother was always excessively nosy and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 187</p>
<p class="calibre1">inquisitive regarding my personal life." Just 20 percent of the non-shy men agreed that such had been the case as far as their own mothers were concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another poignant example of parental hyperseriousness can be seen in the following interview quotation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Several times I sort of implied to my mother that I was really interested in girls and that I was really hurting a lot inside because I couldn't get one. Like I told both of my parents on several occasions that I'd really appreciate it if they would help me meet some girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, whenever I would even vaguely broach the subject with my mother she would invariably tell me to <i class="calibre4"> finish my education first</i> (emphasis his). She'd always say to finish my education first. Now I've got seven years of university education and I'm a 36-year old virgin. So what the hell good did all the piss-hole education do me?!</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm still as incapable as I ever was of getting a woman. Besides being too shy, I don't even know how!" (36-year old loveshy man.) Few of the loveshys had ever discussed their inhibition problems with their parents—at least, not at any length. In many cases the loveshys simply did not have the nerve, particularly in terms of discussing with their parents their shyness problems vis-a-vis the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in quite a few cases this reluctance to discuss these problems with parents had undoubtedly been brought about by crass insensitivity of parents to the loveshyness problem. Thus, parents would brusquely laugh it off, minimize its importance (particularly in comparison with making same-sexed friends and studying hard in school), swiftly change the subject, or angrily moralize with the son about his "not having the gumption to grab the bull by the horns".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Paternal "Sex Anxiety" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been known for quite some time that a condition known as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"sex anxiety" in the <i class="calibre4"> father</i> is related to femininity of attitudes and interests in sons. The "sex anxious" father is simply one who is very uncomfortable about discussing sexual matters. He strongly discourages all sex-related talk within the family, and tends not to be especially demonstrative vis-a-vis his wife, particularly when children are around. Robert Sears was the first social scientist to discover a fairly strong relationship between paternal "sex anxiety" and feminization of interests and behavior patterns in sons. This was in 1957; and since that time scores of other researchers in psychology, in education, and in sociology, have corroborated his findings.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>188 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">In my own study I simply asked each respondent whether or not his father had been comfortable about discussing sex with him during his teenaged years. Of course, misperceptions can be a problem when a researcher is trying to get young men to respond to a question of this nature. Some fathers could have been remembered as having been "comfortable" about the subject even though they had not been. Nevertheless, there is little reason for suspecting that the non-shys would systematically misperceive their fathers as having been comfortable about sex, while the loveshys would misperceive their fathers as having been uncomfortable about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, 65 percent of the non-shy men viewed their fathers as having been comfortable about discussing sexual matters. In contrast, only 28 percent of the older loveshy men recalled their fathers as having been comfortable about discussing sex. The analogous figure for the university aged loveshy men was 36 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of Robert Sears' particularly interesting findings had to do with fathers' interactions with their infant children. He found that "sex anxious" fathers picked up their infant sons to fondle and cuddle them significantly less frequently than did the now-anxious fathers. Interestingly, anxiety over sex tended not to affect the fathers' behavior vis-avis female babies. Girl babies were picked up about equally often by the "sex anxious" fathers as they were by fathers who were not "sex anxious".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tactile contact with boy babies tended to be avoided by "sex anxious" fathers. And this avoidance of touch by fathers was not compensated for by maternal attention. In general, boy babies were found to be picked up by their mothers significantly less often than girl babies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sears speculated that most women as well as "sex anxious" fathers tend to feel uncomfortable vis-a-vis the sight of their son's genitalia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This dearth of tactile contact could be of significance as an antecedent factor in the development of (1) an overly tender self-image, and (2) in the development of severe loveshyness. In his celebrated book titled TOUCHING anthropologist Ashley Montagu marshalled an impressive amount of evidence suggesting that frequent tactile contact throughout the years of infancy and childhood gives rise to an open, trusting sociability, and a relaxed friendliness and openness to others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Montagu's data strongly support this premise for both genders. However, the relationship appears to be especially strong for boys. With data in hand from hundreds of societies around the world, Montagu concluded that boys who had been frequently fondled and touched throughout their formative years made friends far easier and faster than those who had not had this experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 189</p>
<p class="calibre1">Discomfort about nudity in the home is doubtless another good index of "sex anxiety". I therefore asked each man: "What was the attitude towards nudity in your home when you were a child?" And I was somewhat surprised to find that even on this relatively controversial issue fully 67 percent of the non-shy men recalled their home atmosphere as having been rather casual and relaxed with regard to nudity. Indeed, this finding might even be considered somewhat amazing in view of the very high prevalence of <i class="calibre4"> sisters</i> in the homes of the non-shy men. In stark contrast, only 14 percent of the older loveshys recalled their home atmosphere as having been relaxed and reasonably casual with respect to nudity. The analogous figure for the younger loveshy men was 22</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Discomfort about touching, fondling, and about sexual matters generally may be a reflection of underlying shyness and reticence on the part of the father. Of course, all of the loveshys' fathers <i class="calibre4"> had managed</i> to find a woman! All had had sexual intercourse and all had fathered at least one child. This is far more than any of their loveshy sons had ever been able to do. Nevertheless I asked each respondent to react to the statement: "My father is (or was) a very shy man." And 56 percent of the older loveshys <i class="calibre4"> agreed, </i> compared to only 26 percent of the non-shy men. The university aged loveshys were "in between" with 48</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of them agreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, I asked each respondent to react to the statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My father always seemed to have an easy time spontaneously displaying affection towards my mother even when other people were around."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 94 percent of the non-shy men agreed that this had indeed been the case in their own homes. In contrast, only 37 percent of the older loveshys and 49 percent of the younger loveshys viewed this statement as having been correct with respect to the behavior of their own fathers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, the non-shy men were approximately <i class="calibre4"> twice as likely</i> as the men in the two loveshy groups to recall their fathers spontaneously displaying affection towards their mothers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contemporary American society successful heterosexual interaction appears to require a high level of social spontaneity. Men who are emotionally capable of a natural spontaneity vis-a-vis their spouses, lovers, or dating partners, tend to go much farther with women, and they do so much faster. Women feel maximally comfortable with such men, and they want to see more and more of them. In not having had the opportunity to observe such behavior around the house during their formative years, the loveshys lacked a propitious role model upon which they could pattern their own thoughts, behaviors, and subconscious tendencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>190 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Appearance of the Home</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The way parents insist upon keeping their home also reflects upon overall psychoemotional seriousness and upon the ability to relax and to spontaneously enjoy children. In essence, the loveshys' parents tended to have been much more concerned about "appearances" than with genuine, unpretentious, interpersonal interaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following question was contained on all of the questionnaires that were used for this research:</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I was growing up my mother didn't mind if our house or apartment had a casual, "lived in" appearance: False; she always insisted that everything be kept completely neat, straight, and well polished.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She insisted that the place be clean, but she was not compulsive about neatness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">True; my mother was usually quite relaxed in regard to the appearance of the house or apartment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 5 percent of the non-shy men checked the first option: that their mothers had always fastidiously insisted that everything be kept completely neat and straight, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In contrast, fully 47 percent of the older loveshy men together with 36 percent of the younger ones checked this alternative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, the last of the three alternatives was not especially popular among any of the three research groups. Just 16 percent of the younger loveshys and 6 percent of the younger love shys. In essence, most of the non-shy men checked the second alternative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I asked the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Which of the following comes closest to describing the interior of your house or apartment while you were growing up?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Very neat, well-ordered and tidy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Warm, with a casual "lived in" appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And here fully 80 percent of the non-shy men checked the "warm and casual" option, compared to only 37 percent of the older loveshys and 48 percent of the younger ones. Putting it another way, only 20</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shys thought their house had usually been kept "very neat, well-ordered and tidy", compared to a full 63 percent of the older l o v e - s h y  m e n .</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 191</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Parental Overprotectiveness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is evidence suggesting that the loveshys' parents had been more overprotective than the parents of the non-shys. This is especially true as far as moralistic issues are concerned. For example, I asked each man to react to the following: <i class="calibre4"> "Before</i> I was 17 years old, if I had wanted very badly to see an <i class="calibre4"> 'R' </i> rated film, I could usually count on at least one of my parents taking me to see it." Fully 57 percent of the non-shys indicated "true" for this statement, compared to only 23 percent of the young loveshys, and just 16 percent of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, there is evidence that the loveshys' parents were quite <i class="calibre4"> disinclined</i> to be protective, much less "overprotective", when it came to their sons' unwillingness to fight back against the assaults of school bullies, and when it came to participation in the sorts of "rough and tumble" contact play that boys are "supposed to" relish. Most of the loveshys' parents were, in fact, quite disappointed about their sons'</p>
<p class="calibre1">non-masculine behavior patterns. And quite a few of the loveshys could recall numerous instances of having been thrown out of the house and angrily told to go play with the boys. On these occasions the loveshys would almost invariably take long walks or bicycle rides by themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And even today most of the loveshys claimed that they find taking long walks and long drives by themselves to be quite conducive to rich fantasy and daydreams. They also find such solitary activities to be a good antidepressant.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Negative Comparison</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent "How often did your mother or father compare you unfavorably with your brothers and/or sisters?" And <i class="calibre4"> excluding from consideration all respondents who had been only children, </i> 47 percent of the older loveshys and 38 percent of the younger ones had experienced such unfavorable comparisons on a "frequent" basis, compared to only 12 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such adverse comparisons, particularly when they are made on a frequent basis and in the child's presence, can prove highly embarrassing and can have a very deleterious impact upon a child's developing self-image, self-pride, and sense of self-worth. The fact that the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents had been particularly prone towards making such disparaging comparisons can be seen in the pattern of responses to this question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How often did your mother or father compare you unfavorably in regard to other children of your own age and sex?" Fully 52 percent of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>192 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the non-shy men indicated that their parents had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> made such disparaging comparisons. In contrast, only 12 percent of the older loveshys together with 19 percent of the younger ones could similarly say that their parents had <i class="calibre4"> never</i> made such disparaging comparisons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, 55 percent of the parents of the older loveshy men were recalled as having made such disparaging comparisons to their sons'</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces quite "frequently"; 46 percent of the younger loveshys similarly recalled their parents having done this on a "frequent" basis. On the other hand, only 13 percent of the non-shy men could recall their parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">"frequently" comparing them in an unflattering way to other children of their age and sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite related to the foregoing is the experience of having been criticized, scolded or punished in front of other children or adults. Again, frequent experiences of this sort can have a strongly deleterious impact upon a child's developing self-image and sense of social self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they can also have a bearing upon the development of social avoidance habits. It should be recalled that inhibited (melancholic) children find it extremely difficult to forget embarrassing experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent: "How frequently were you criticized, scolded or punished by your parents <i class="calibre4"> in front of</i> other adults?" And 67</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys along with 57 percent of the younger ones indicated that this had happened to them "sometimes" or "frequently".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, this experience had happened "sometimes" or "frequently"</p>
<p class="calibre1">to only 19 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The story was very much the same in regard to public scolding and/or punishment taking place in front of other children. I asked each respondent: "How frequently were you criticized, scolded or punished by your parents <i class="calibre4"> in front of</i> other children?" And despite the fact that few of the loveshys had had any friends while they were growing up, fully 89 percent of the older loveshy men along with 73 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that this had happened to them either "sometimes"</p>
<p class="calibre1">or "frequently". The analogous percent for the non-shy men was only 45.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among those who had checked <i class="calibre4"> "frequently", </i> the percents were 49</p>
<p class="calibre1">and 41 for the older and younger loveshy men respectively. Only 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shy men recalled having been criticized, scolded or punished on a "frequent" basis in front of other children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' parents quite clearly did not model effective or emotionally rewarding interpersonal relationships. They provided no viable model at all for competent and harmonious <i class="calibre4"> conflict resolution skills. </i> Conflicts arise in all human relationships. And I think the characteristic behavior of the loveshys' parents did much to make the loveshys <i class="calibre4"> fear</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 193</p>
<p class="calibre1">conflict and hostility. And in so doing, I think these parents' personalities indirectly inspired socially avoidant behavior. After all, if a person is not involved in any meaningful interpersonal relationships he or she will never need to deal with potentially painful conflicts, hostilities, disagreements, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> By remaining a social isolate one can assure oneself of <i class="calibre4"> external</i> harmony (absence of social friction), even though <i class="calibre4"> internal</i> harmony might as a consequence remain permanently elusive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' fear of potential conflict situations vis-a-vis parents is well reflected in the pattern of reactions to this questionnaire statement: "I always felt free and comfortable about discussing my problems with my parents." Only 19 percent of the non-shy men indicated that this was <i class="calibre4"> untrue. </i> In contrast, 66 percent of the older loveshys and 57</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys indicated that this statement had been <i class="calibre4">untrue</i> as far as their formative years in their parents' homes had been concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Forcing the Summer Camp Experience on Children</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the especially curious findings I uncovered in conducting the interviews for this book was that the loveshys were significantly more likely than the non-shy men to have been to summer camp <i class="calibre4"> at all</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite irrespective of whether or not they had ever been forced to attend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 48 percent of the non-shy men had ever been to a summer camp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, 83 percent of the older loveshys and 72 percent of the younger ones had been to a summer camp at least once at some time in their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, of the non-shys who had ever been to a summer camp, 60 percent indicated that they had <i class="calibre4"> enjoyed</i> the experience. Of the loveshys who had ever been to a summer camp,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older ones and just 15 percent of the younger ones indicated that they had enjoyed the experience to any extent at all. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> of the non-shy men hated the summer camp experience. In contrast, 68 percent of the older loveshys and 57 percent of the younger ones said that they had hated the experience. The remaining men felt indifferent about their experiences with summer camp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 61 percent of the older loveshy men had been forced by their parents to attend summer camp at least once. Most of these men had been forced to attend during several consecutive summers. Among the younger loveshys 43 percent had been forced to attend summer camp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That figure is substantially lower than the 61 percent figure for the older loveshys. But even it is high by comparison with the 7 percent figure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>194 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the self-confident non-shy men. More specifically,  <i class="calibre4"> only seven percent</i> of the non-shys had ever been forced by their parents to attend summer camp. The remaining 41 percent of non-shy men who had been to camp had gone because they had <i class="calibre4"> wanted</i> to go. (Again, only 48 percent of the non-shys had ever been to camp.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">These findings suggest that the very fact of a child being <i class="calibre4"> forced</i> to attend summer camp against his/her will is <i class="calibre4"> itself</i> a good indicator of a pathogenic,  <i class="calibre4"> loveshyness generating family. </i> Hence, this is something about which school guidance counselors and psychiatric social workers ought to be made aware. Indeed, it may be quite prudent to get laws passed at both the state and the federal level barring summer camp administrators from accepting children into their institutions who are there by force rather than by choice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Summer camp administrators tend to be quite moralistic, and cannot be trusted on their own to accomplish the needed screening of children. In the camp administrator's way of thinking the boy or girl who is sent to camp is very lucky indeed; and he/she ought to be very grateful to his/her parents for their financial sacrifice. Also, most summer camps are profit-making organizations. And this together with various moralistic ideas about how "lucky" these children are, contributes to an ideology that runs rough-shod over the needs and feelings of male children who happen to be passive, inhibited, shy and withdrawn. In essence, camp administrators are <i class="calibre4"> sales people; </i> and the idea that what they have to offer may be "bad" for some children is <i class="calibre4"> unthinkable</i> to them. This is as true for those who run YMCA, Boy Scout, and religious camps, as it is for those who manage expensive, private camps. Summer camp administrators have a strong set of vested interests which eventuate in their defending their product in the face of any and all kinds of opposition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, there is evidence that substantial numbers of parents use summer camps as depositories for temporarily getting rid of their children. As a case in point, the following statement yielded a pattern of responses which sharply differentiated the loveshys from the non-shys:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Generally speaking, I think I was less important to my mother than her friends were." Fully 43 percent of the older loveshys together with 36 percent of the younger ones <i class="calibre4"> agreed</i> with this statement. In contrast, <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys chose to agree with the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, it appears that a substantial proportion of the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents had failed to display any real sensitivity toward their sons' needs and feelings. And this general insensitivity was eventually reflected in the unusually high popularity of summer camps among the ranks of the loveshys' parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 195</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Summer Camps as Torture Prisons</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the men I interviewed complained bitterly about their experiences of having been "incarcerated" or "imprisoned" in these "torture chambers" known as summer camps. The non-shys had relished and thoroughly enjoyed most of their summer camp experiences because camp provided a copious abundance of opportunities for engaging in the "rough and tumble" baseball/football activities which they had always enjoyed anyway. Thus the non-shys had looked upon camp as a place to hone up their athletic skills, and to meet and compete with many new boys of their own age.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the loveshy, on the other hand, summer camp had been a place of interminable torture and bullying. It was a place where they had been isolated from <i class="calibre4"> girls, </i> the one class of human beings in their age group whom they had always <i class="calibre4"> wanted</i> to be around, to look at, and to longingly stare at.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually, the loveshys had many more interests and hobbies throughout their childhoods than the non-shys did. But all of the loveshys' interests and hobbies (except for swimming, which was frequently mentioned) were quiet, solitary ones such as reading, nature study, map collecting, ceramics, listening to music, arts and crafts, taking long walks or bicycle rides, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Hence, the summer camp experience failed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"expand" them from the standpoint of interests. In fact, in some ways the camp experience had had a constricting impact. The following comment is illustrative of this:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I always loved swimming at the beach. When I was a kid I would sometimes spend three or four hours in the ocean without ever coming out. My mother used to scream at me because she thought it might be bad for me to stay in the water so long. Sometimes other kids in the water would talk to me. But I usually swam and rode the waves all by myself. Anyway, one of the things that really surprised me about all the different camps I attended was that I couldn't do much swimming. They give you only one hour of free swimming per day. And by the time you adjust to the cold lake water, the hour is almost up. I took much longer to get my body completely into the water than any of the other kids did. I can't adjust to cold water very fast, and the lake water at camp was much colder than the ocean is.  <i class="calibre4"> (Note:</i> This person grew up in Newport Beach, California.) It sometimes took 45 minutes before I could even get myself into the water; and the other kids would be teasing and splashing me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that slowed me down all the more, and made me withdraw. It was really bad because they wouldn't let you go in the water without a 'buddy' at the camps I attended. And the kid the counselors assigned</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>196 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">me to would be screaming and throwing rocks at me because my inability to adapt to the cold water meant that he couldn't go in either. None of those people would have ever guessed that I was a real 'fish' when I was home and had my freedom at the beach." (20</p>
<p class="calibre1">year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is another comment that is poignantly revealing as to how thoroughly <i class="calibre4"> out of their element</i> the loveshys had been at all-male summer camps:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember every day about an hour before lunchtime they made us line up and march in military fashion. I absolutely hated this because I was always getting it from the guys behind me who would be constantly kicking the backs of my ankles. The people who ran this camp must have been absolute animals. I remember the counselors tried to force everyone to shout these horrible chants. I remember one which went:</p>
<p class="calibre1">'You're in the Army now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you're in the Army now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you dig a ditch,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you sonofabitch,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you're in the Army now.'</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd be the only kid who wouldn't cooperate in hollaring these unromantic, horrible, stupid things. And I'd be screamed at and punched by the kids and sometimes even by the counselors  . . . . While the kids were hollaring these horrible things and trying to make me keep in step, I'd be in a deep, romantic reverie about walking on a beach or in some beautiful forest somewhere with a beautiful girl who loved me. I would be so deep in my daydreams about being with a girl that I would become totally oblivious to the people who were shouting at me and calling me all sorts of foul names. The fact that I was totally unresponsive to all this abuse got some of the counselors really mad. I remember the only thing that unnerved me was when the kids who were marching in back of me kicked my legs or ankles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the counselors usually stopped them from doing that. So I was usually able to spend most of this stupid marching time off in my world of romantic daydreams." (36-year old loveshy man.) Of course, it wasn't just military chanting which turned the loveshys off.  <i class="calibre4"> Any</i> type of repetitive chanting had the same effect on them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the loveshys commented upon how they had gotten into trouble at church or religious meetings that had been forced on them—</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they would not partake in the required group chanting. Again, while the chanting was going on they would have their minds off in a world of romantic daydreams. And at the center of all of their daydreams</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness  1 9 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a beautiful girl friend. As I shall make clear in chapter eleven, a beautiful girlfriend loomed at the center of the loveshys' daydreams <i class="calibre4">throughout</i> all the years of elementary school and high school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the especially salient memories recalled during the interviews by the loveshy men entailed painful scenarios of being forced by counselors to join a baseball playing group out in the bright, glaring sun. Many of the men vividly recalled the extreme discomforts to their eyes of being out in very bright sunshine and being chided and hazed by boys whom they simply did not want to be with. Some of the men felt that the counselors were sincerely trying to do the best thing, and that most of the counselors simply didn't have any awareness of the deleterious impact that their coercive tactics were having.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the camp craft shop these loveshy men had evidently been enthusiastic artisans. But on the baseball diamond they were listless and unwilling outsiders. Even though they were technically on somebody's team (and <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the other boys wanted them to be on <i class="calibre4"> their</i> team), in reality they were on the baseball diamond only in body and not in spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of these men, in fact, had kept their hands cuped over their eyes and remained oblivious in the outfield even when a ball passed right by them. Several of the loveshys spontaneously mentioned that they breathed a sigh of relief every time a cloudy day dawned. For even if baseball were to be forced upon them on such a day, they would at least not have to deal with the painfulness of the glaring sun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Partly because of their noncompetitive nature, the loveshys were like "fish out of water" at camp. Among groups of young boys almost everything is rushed at in a frenzied, competitive way. And boys who do not take an enthusiastic interest in the competition tend to be castigated with an unlimited barrage of highly disparaging,  <i class="calibre4"> ad hominem</i> swear words— like "fuck face", "asshole", "turd brain", "chicken shit",</p>
<p class="calibre1">"shitass", "shithead", "fairy queen", "faggot", "cocksucking queer", and scores of others. Parents who go to great trouble to see to it that their children do not see any <i class="calibre4"> "R" </i> rated motion pictures ought to be accorded the opportunity of witnessing six or seven year old boys at a <i class="calibre4"> middle-class</i> summer camp constantly spewing out a never-ending flow of <i class="calibre4"> ad hominem</i> swear words so venomous that one would be hard pressed to find <i class="calibre4"> any</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"R" </i> or <i class="calibre4"> "X" </i> rated motion picture that could hold a candle to it!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enforced participation (and they do not <i class="calibre4"> really</i> "participate" even when they are forced) in "rough and tumble" contact sports is only part of the picture. Non-shy boys at summer camp tend to become quite ferociously competitive over such matters as the neatness and cleanliness of their cabin. Here again, the loveshys wanted to be <i class="calibre4"> left alone. </i> To them their cubby hole, trunk and bunk <i class="calibre4"> was theirs, </i> and it was <i class="calibre4"> their own private</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>198 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">business</i> as to how they kept these things. Most of the loveshys suffered severe physical bullying and cruelty at the hands of their peers during what was supposed to be "clean up time".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most summer camp counselors are themselves young men who are in no way equipped to deal constructively and appropriately with their loveshy charges. Many of them are working their way through college, and their awareness of the fields of child development and parenting is limited to their recollections of their own parents' behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vis-a-vis children whose temperament and behavior is "mainstream", most young men in camp counselor jobs manage to perform quite well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Withdrawn and inhibited boys, on the other hand, are simply not understood by them. Withdrawn and inhibited boys seldom inspire the best from summer camp counselors. Indeed, even the counselors sometimes end up teasing and hazing such loveshy children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, one loveshy man recounted the following set of experiences surrounding required games of "capture the flag".</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Every third or fourth night after dinner the counselors used to make us play 'capture the flag' for an hour. I hated this and had absolutely no interest in it. But the thing that makes me shudder even today when I think about it is that the counselors always assigned me to the team that had to take their shirts off. At seven o'clock all the mosquitos came out, and I was absolutely in a torture chamber every time. I went to complain to the camp president about it, and he refused to do anything about it. Nobody would help me. They would come over and take my shirt away so I couldn't put it back on. And for a solid hour I would be flailing my hands all over my body trying to keep the mosquitos away. And the kids would be throwing rocks at me and making fun at me while all of this was going on." (38-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Homesickness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Homesickness is a problem from which many young children suffer when they are sent away from home for the first time. Curiously, however, I do not believe that homesickness had affected any of the loveshy men whom I studied for this book. To be sure, most of the loveshys absolutely hated summer camp. To most of them camp was a real</p>
<p class="calibre1">"house of horrors". But despite the interminable bullying and hazing, none of them could recall any deep yearning to be home with their parents. In essence, what the loveshys missed most was <i class="calibre4"> their freedom,</i> NOT their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshys viewed their parents as callous, insensitive jailors, and not as the benign kinfolk whose warm glow of love they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 199</p>
<p class="calibre1">will once again be able to enjoy. Few of the loveshys felt that their parents really cared about or had any awareness at all of their deepest needs and feelings. They saw their parents only as people who <i class="calibre4"> cared</i> about molding them into a preconceived image of a "normal boy". They did not view their parents as accepting and loving them <i class="calibre4"> as they were,</i> but only as something which the summer camp experience might help make them into.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys had always felt quite lonely around their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not surprising when it is borne in mind that the loveshys had always felt too shy and inhibited about discussing with their parents what had always been throughout their childhoods the most important thing in their lives. In essence, they were too shy about sharing with their parents their daydreams about having a beautiful girlfriend, and about their deep, romantic infatuations with a particular girl at their school. The loveshys' parents virtually never entertained even the slightest inkling about what was <i class="calibre4"> really</i> salient in their inhibited and withdrawn sons' minds. In this sense, the loveshys and their parents had always been quite total strangers vis-a-vis each other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the loveshys were anxious to "get out" of camp just as a prisoner is anxious to "get out" after he has done his time. The loveshys looked forward to being able once again to take long rides on their bicycles by themselves, to taking long walks, getting back to their music, reading, arts and crafts hobbies, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Aside from getting the money, food, clothing, shelter, etc., that they needed, the loveshys tended not to look forward to seeing their parents. They <i class="calibre4"> knew</i> that the verbally abusive explosions from their parents would soon be recommencing again—within a few days of their arrival home. Indeed, how could the loveshys logically be expected to be "homesick" for their jailors—for those who had been responsible for their incarceration, and ultimately in an indirect way for all the bullying and <i class="calibre4"> ad hominem</i> hazing that had followed this incarceration? Of course, the parents had sent their sons to camp in hopes that the experience would "make a real man" out of them. Not surprisingly, it didn't work!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parents and Inheritance</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of their comparative youth, the issue of inheritance did not come up in any of my interviews with the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was a major preoccupation for a considerable minority of the older loveshys, and particularly for the 31 percent who had grown up as <i class="calibre4"> only children. </i> Despite the fact that none of these men had ever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>2 0 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed cordial relations with their mothers and fathers, all felt somewhat guilty and distraught about the fact that their parents had no one to whom to leave their tangible (non-monetary) worldly goods and property.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My parents keep reminding me that they have so many nice things, and no one to leave them to. My parents were always very different from me. They always had a lot of friends. And they have this expensive silver service; they have all these expensive dishes, living room set, dining room set, and all kinds of other heirlooms. When I'm around my mother sometimes cries that all this stuff will just have to be auctioned off. You know, like what's the point of leaving stuff like that to a single man who doesn't have any friends, and who lives in a cockroach infested one-room flat! Of course, with all the friends my parents have wined and dined over the years, you'd think they'd have somebody who would be willing to introduce me to some eligible women! You'd think that parents with all those social connections would be able to help their son! I'm their only kid, and yet they won't lift a finger for me. They claim that I'm an embarrassment to them. All they can do is complain and cry that they haven't got anyone to leave their stuff to. All this makes me feel very angry. And yet whenever I think about it I get more depressed than angry because my hands are tied! What can I do about it?!" (39-year old loveshy man who is an "only child".)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think the most painful thing when my mother was dying was that she had no one to leave her heirlooms to. I know she had been praying for grandchildren. Everytime I saw her she would remind me that I had a responsibility to give her grandchildren. And I would have to constantly remind her that I was too shy to get a wife. I mean you have to be able to date in order to be able to get married.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And you have to be married in order to have any children. See, my mother thinks I'm a fag, because that's what my dad kept saying before he died. There was nothing I could do to convince her that I was anything but a fag—that there was nothing I wanted more than to have a loving wife and family. I just couldn't make her understand the concept of shyness—that I was as normal as anybody else—just shy  . . . . Anyway, what happened was that I inherited 25 percent of what my mother had in the bank. The other 75 percent and all of the heirlooms and house went to my cousin and her family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost funny because my mother never even saw my cousin more than twice a year. I don't think she even liked her very much.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean she would always criticize my cousin about one damn thing or another. Yet it was my cousin who got all the inheritance, not me." (49-year old loveshy man who had been an "only child".)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"My parents are really distraught. I hate my parents, and yet I feel really badly about the fact that they are evidently not going to be able to die knowing that their only son is going to be able to lead a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>Parents as a Cause of LoveShyness 201</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal life. I guess I wouldn't mind so much if I had chosen to live this way. Like some people choose to be priests. But that's okey because they <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> to be celebate; they <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> not to marry or to have children. I never chose to live like this; and yet both I and my parents have to suffer the consequences of a life style which I never chose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think I'll get the inheritance money. But they've already told me that unless I'm married at the time their will goes through probate, all of their property is going to be given to charity." (41-year old loveshy "only child".)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "only child" cases seemed to be the most sad and poignant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, loveshys with brothers and/or sisters had no easy "row to hoe" either with respect to the inheritance issue. Many of the loveshys had become the "black sheep" of their respective families. And this was reflected in the fact that the loveshys visited and/or were visited by their parents a very great deal less often than were their non-shy brothers and sisters. Married siblings, in particular, received a great deal more attention from their aging mothers and fathers than did these loveshy men. And this was true irrespective of whether or not the married siblings had children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today an increasing number of journalists and scholarly writers are asserting that the single life represents "a legitimate choice", and that those pursuing this "choice" are no less happy and no more lonely than those who pursue the more traditional choices of marriage and parenthood.2 The important word here, of course, is <i class="calibre4"> "choice". </i> And at the risk of being redundant I must repeat that the loveshy men never</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"chose" </i> their life style. Indeed, their life style is highly antithetical to their desires and to their value systems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that it is also antithetical to their aging parents' value systems may be entirely beside the point. If an adult child is happy and positive about his <i class="calibre4"> chosen</i> life style, that child is likely to be perceived by his aging parents as <i class="calibre4"> "a joy to be around". </i> On the other hand, if an adult child is quiet and obviously unhappy about the life style with which he is "stuck"—if he is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> positive and enthusiastic about the life he is leading, then the aging parents are bound to feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, guilty, and not especially proud or happy about having their adult son around.</p>
