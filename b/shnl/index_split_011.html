<a id="p26"></a> <i class="calibre4">Preface</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past twenty years a tremendous number of books and magazine articles have been written about the so-called sexual revolution. However, virtually no attention at all has ever been accorded a class of people whom the sexual revolution has totally bypassed. This book will allow the reader to learn about a very fascinating segment of the population which can best be described as <i class="calibre4"> "loveshy." </i> The loveshy include fully grown men in their late 30s and 40s who are not only as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"virginal" as it is possible for anyone to be, but who can also be accurately described as less experienced in ordinary dating, courting, and elementary kissing than the typical, contemporary 12-year old youngster. The loveshy also include 19 to 24 year old university students who are similarly incapable of getting started with the opposite sex, quite in spite of their very strong desires for a close, loving heterosexual relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No, these are not homosexual men by a long shot. In fact, this book is devoted exclusively to men with very strong and very normal heterosexual urges. Indeed, it is devoted to men who would like nothing better than to be able to marry and to have children, but who are not moving towards these goals because of severe bashfulness, shyness and social timidity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness is a life-crippling condition. Victims of loveshyness cannot marry. They cannot have children, and they cannot participate in the normal adolescent and young adult activities of dating and courtship. The loveshy are often misperceived as "homosexual." And they are often made to pay the price for being "homosexual" without being accorded access to the rewards that go with a homosexual identity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because loveshy people are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> homosexual they cannot join up with any of the many "gay rights" organizations or homosexual support groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as very few loveshy people are alcoholic, Alcoholics Anonymous is similarly "off limits" to them.  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the loveshy ever take part in any form of gambling or risk-taking, social <i class="calibre4"> or</i> financial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So Gamblers Anonymous is also "off limits" to them. And so are all of the various substance abuse and drug addict support groups. With very xxi</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>xxii Preface</p>
<p class="calibre1">few exceptions, the loveshy do not take drugs. In fact, they do not allow themselves to become involved in <i class="calibre4"> anything</i> or in <i class="calibre4"> any activity, </i> whole-some or otherwise, for which there is any kind of existent social support group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That is the whole trouble. The loveshy do not have anybody to relate to as a friend or to count on for emotional support. They deeply crave heterosexual love and romance. Most of them would like to have children. And yet all of these normal life activities and rewards are blocked to them. In fact, they are about as severely cut off from these normal social gratifications as they would be if they were serving a life sentence in a federal or state prison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So how did the loveshy get to be the way they are? Can they be cured? And if so, how might this be accomplished? These are just some of the questions with which this book will deal. Every day loveshyness creates enormous pain and suffering for some 1.7 million American males whose normal desires for self-determination and self-expression are thwarted by their condition. And yet up until quite recently this quite sizable proportion of the population has been almost totally ignored by authors, journalists, scholarly reserachers, the clergy, and members of the helping professions. This book is, in point of fact, the very first of its kind ever to be published either here in the United States or anyplace else in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, this book does far more than merely address the problem of loveshyness. Fully 300 loveshy males, ranging in age from 19</p>
<p class="calibre1">to 50, were extensively interviewed and studied for this book. Their lifestyles, personal histories and thought processes were carefully scrutinized and compared to those of 200 non-shy men. And this book contains the results of this research, all of which is presented here in the language of the layperson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, various therapeutic and preventive approaches for dealing with loveshyness are reviewed in this volume. And those which up to now have shown the greatest promise are highlighted. To be specific, even the most severely loveshy man <i class="calibre4"> can now be cured</i> (and comparatively painlessly), although the process requires some amount of time and resources. The how, why and wherefore of therapeutic and preventive measures <i class="calibre4"> which work</i> will be both detailed and explained in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This book was written with the victims of loveshyness constantly in mind. And as author of this book I sincerely hope that it reaches as many afflicted people as possible. One of the major lessons which almost a decade of researching loveshyness has taught me is that the loveshy need to band together both as a social/political force <i class="calibre4"> and</i> as social networks providing needed friendship and social support. As of now, there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>Preface xxiii</p>
<p class="calibre1">is no <i class="calibre4"> "Shys Anonymous." </i> I strongly hope that one of the fruits of this book will be the development of such a nationwide organization, and of other support organizations such as <i class="calibre4"> "Coed Scouts," </i> and "practice-dating" support groups. As a socio-political force the loveshy can and should begin making themselves visible; they can begin now to make their needs known to the "powers that be." And, most importantly, they can begin getting their most basic human rights honored <i class="calibre4"> and their</i> <i class="calibre4">needs met. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is intended for interested laypersons, therapists, and scholarly researchers. Loveshyness is a surprisingly fascinating topic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I believe that a key reason for its inherent interest and fascination is that most people can learn a surprisingly great deal about themselves from studying the underlying causes of behavioral inhibitions. Loveshyness is a form of <i class="calibre4"> deviance. </i> It is a form of <i class="calibre4"> behavioral nonconformity. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Deviance (nonconformity) is the <i class="calibre4"> opposite side ofthe same coin as conformity</i> <i class="calibre4">and "normality." </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, loveshyness is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> a freely chosen form of behavioral nonconformity. And that is why the loveshy are often regarded as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"sick," "neurotic," "unfriendly," <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Freely selected nonconformist lifestyles are usually quite healthy. Every society needs some amount of freely selected behavioral nonconformity. Without it a society would begin to stagnate. Nonconformists who deliberately and rationally choose their behavioral style often accord their society and local communities a great deal of useful "fresh air" and creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But for the loveshy free choice and self-determination are unknown and unsavored experiences. In short, the underlying roots of both personal and societal health can be better appreciated through a careful and systematic study of those persons who do not have such health, and who do not enjoy the free choice and self-determination which most of us take for granted each day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So if you want to understand how human beings come to be and feel "free," or if you simply want to help yourself or a loved one who may be suffering the throes of loveshyness, read on. I can guarantee you a host of new and useful insights both about yourself <i class="calibre4"> and</i> about those who, despite their strong heterosexual/romantic needs, cannot obtain or experience the emotionally meaningful love and companionship of someone of the opposite sex.</p>

<a id="p32"></a>Chapter 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Introduction</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Only about 5.5 percent of the male population in America never marries. Approximately 50 percent of this group is believed to be composed of homosexuals who have chosen not to marry. And about one-half of what remains is composed of heterosexual men who for a variety of personal reasons have similarly <i class="calibre4"> chosen</i> on a voluntary basis not to marry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is about heterosexual, "single, never married" men who <i class="calibre4">have never voluntarily chosen</i> to remain "single, never married", but who have been constrained to remain that way because of severe shyness in informal social situations involving women. This form of chronic, severe shyness can best be labeled <i class="calibre4"> "loveshyness". </i> And it afflicts approximately 1.5 percent of all American males. More succinctly, loveshyness will effectively prevent about 1.7 million males currently residing in the United States from ever marrying and from ever experiencing any form of intimate sexual contact with a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today many young women complain about what they perceive to be a serious shortage of eligible heterosexual men who are desirous of a permanent, intimate, committed relationship with a woman. As this book will make quite clear, the loveshy constitute a rich and long neglected supply of such men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Until quite recently the problem of shyness was ignored by social scientists. Yet few if any personal problems are associated with greater suffering for the individual victim or pose a greater potential danger for society. Shyness inhibits and very often obviates free choice and responsible self-determination. This poses a very serious dilemma because American society was founded upon the principle of rational self-direction and self-determination. Indeed, the principle of free choice underlies the very philosophy upon which our legal and political way of life rests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The American way of life is also in very large measure dependent upon the ability and willingness of all citizens to speak out, to voice their ideas, and to contribute to the common good commensurate with 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>2 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">their strengths and abilities. It is further dependent upon each person being able to constructively deal with and satisfy his or her own needs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No person who is prevented from effectively contributing and receiving in line with his or her own assets and abilities can be happy. No person who is prevented from playing meaningful roles in or from being an integral part of his or her society can be stable. Unfulfilled and unhappy people tend to create problems both for themselves and for society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be shy is to have one's actions (or lack of them) misunderstood, misinterpreted and misread by others. An extreme fear of the pain of anxiety prevents the shy person from taking the kinds of action that are in accordance with his or her values, wishes, knowledge and rational judgment. More simply put, shyness inhibits people from assuming a sense of responsibility for their behavior. It makes them feel and truly believe that they are not in the "driver's seat" of their own lives and destinies. Shy people disclaim responsibility for their inaction and for their seemingly (to others) unfriendly, detached attitude. This inability to effectively deal with the interpersonal anxiety which for them accompanies normal social intercourse makes them feel that they are not "in charge of" or responsible for their own lives and for the behavior which they manifest to others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that shys can seldom perform up to the level of their potential is a further problem as it gives rise to a tremendous waste of human resources and talent. Shys' extreme fear of interpersonal anxiety and of rejection prevents them from taking prudent risks and from developing necessary social skills. This leads to a vicious circle of ever increasing shyness, social withdrawal, and low social self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Webster dictionary defines shyness as being "uncomfortable in the presence of others." The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that the word's earliest recorded use was in an Anglo-Saxon poem written around 1000 AD, in which it meant "easily frightened." They define shyness as being "wary in speech or action, shrinking from self-assertion; sensitively timid; retiring or reserved from diffidence, and cautiously averse in encountering or having to do with some specified person or group."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most definitions stress that shyness pertains to <i class="calibre4"> social</i> fears and anxieties. Accordingly this book views shyness as: A state of behavioral inaction or avoidance in <i class="calibre4"> social</i> situations that is out of harmony with a person's conscious wants, needs and values, and which is precipitated by a real or imagined social situation clashing with that person's low interpersonal anxiety threshold and unusually strong fear of anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Social</i> situations can be classified into two basic categories: (1) the impersonal, and (2) the purely sociable. Many social situations entail no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>Introduction 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">essential purpose apart from pure, unadulterated sociability. These are fundamentally ambiguous situations in which there is no clear script, and in which there is no role to play. On the other hand, many people are shy in certain kinds of <i class="calibre4"> impersonal</i> social situations. This is particularly true with regard to situations calling for such public performance as speech making in front of a large audience, singing and acting in public, piano playing, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book will concern itself with victims of the first type of shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is perfectly possible for a person to go through life quite happy and content, and yet never get over his/her fears of public performance, public speechmaking, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In contrast, it is downright unfathomable for a person to go through life incapable of comfortably interacting in <i class="calibre4"> informal</i> social situations, and still remain happy and content. Simply put, shyness in purely informal social situations has a far more deleterious, damaging impact upon a person's mental health and happiness than any other kind of shyness. And this is why such shyness warrents careful study and scrutiny.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, people who are very shy in purely friendly, social situations are quite often <i class="calibre4"> also</i> shy in impersonal situations as well. Yet it is almost always much easier to cure shyness in impersonal situations than it is to cure shyness in purely informal social situations. In order to function effectively in any impersonal situation all a person needs to do is (1) learn a "script" or "role" as well as he/she can, and (2) gain sufficient self-confidence to go public with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In purely informal social situations, on the other hand, there is no</p>
<p class="calibre1">"script" or "role" to learn. Purely sociable situations are <i class="calibre4"> inherently ambiguous</i> by nature. They call for the participants to <i class="calibre4"> be themselves, </i> and to be able to spontaneously improvise their performance as they go along. In American society many people (especially males) have developed a trained incapacity for "being themselves". They cannot "be themselves" because they do not really know who they actually are! People <i class="calibre4"> become themselves</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">develop a firm sense of identity—only through informal interaction from early childhood onward in informal friendship and kinship groups. For reasons this book will make clear, a significant minority of American boys grow up friendless, as <i class="calibre4"> social isolates. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Since a person cannot learn a "script" or "role" in preparation for effective performance in purely friendly, sociable situations (which are in many ways inherently ambiguous), there is no easy way a person can gain the self-confidence he needs in order to test himself out. In doing the research necessary for delivering a stimulating public lecture, a person will inevitably gain quite a bit of self-confidence. At the outset he might be "scared shitless" about talking for an hour before a large audience about some subject. But the more he learns, the more he wants</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>4 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">to share, and the faster and smoother his "script" manages to get put together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same thing applies to rehearsals in preparation for putting on a stage play or musical. At the outset some of the performers may be quite frightened about "going on" before a large, paying audience. Yet as regular, disciplined rehearsals effectively hone up the players' roles to the point of perfection, most of the initial stage fright subsides, and each player begins looking forward to opening night. Yes, even fine actors and actresses will have some stage fright as the overture blares away on opening night. But as the curtain goes up these jitters are almost always forgotten. The actors and actresses <i class="calibre4"> take command</i> because they know their roles and are very comfortable with them. The chance that anything unpredictable will happen on stage as the performance unfolds is almost nil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Purely sociable situations do not allow for any such beforehand preparation. To most readers of this book "being friendly" in purely sociable situations seems to be "the most natural thing in the world".</p>
<p class="calibre1">To a severely shy man, on the other hand, it represents a far more frightening prospect than does assuming responsibility for any public lecture or public performance.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">What is LoveShyness? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is interested in a particular kind of shyness which prevails in <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> or <i class="calibre4"> man/woman</i> situations wherein there is no purpose apart from pure, unadulterated friendliness and sociability. This type of shyness can best be termed <i class="calibre4"> "loveshyness",-, </i> and it is the most painful and life-crippling of all kinds of shyness. Just as shyness in purely sociable situations is far more painful than shyness in impersonal business 01</p>
<p class="calibre1">performance situations, shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex for virtually all of its victims is far more painful than any other kind of shyness, According to the best evidence at our disposal, loveshyness has a more disastrous impact upon the lives of its victims than any other kind ol shyness. And that is why this book will confine its attention exclusively to <i class="calibre4"> loveshyness, </i> its causes, consequences, and remedies (both preventive and therapeutic).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gender Factor</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness can be found among people of all ages and of both sexes. However, research evidence indicates that the problem impacts far more severely upon males than it does upon females. Women who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Introduction 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">remain loveshy throughout lengthy periods of their lives usually adapt very well and often quite happily to their situations. Spinsters, for example, often become highly successful career women. The never-married woman typically goes through life with <i class="calibre4"> fewer</i> mental and physical health problems than her <i class="calibre4"> married</i> sister of the same age. In stark contrast, the never-married, heterosexually inactive man has long been known to be vulnerable to all manner of quite serious and often bizarre pathologies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Data recently obtained by Stanford University researcher Paul Pilkonis strongly suggests that shy women are no more likely to be neurotic than non-shy women. This same study, on the other hand, found shy men to be far more likely than non-shy men to be suffering from very severe neurotic conditions. In American society some degree of shyness is considered tolerable and even quite socially acceptable in females. In <i class="calibre4">males</i> of all ages from kindergarten through all the years of adulthood, in contrast, shyness is widely viewed as very deviant and highly undesirable. Moreover, shyness in males inspires bullying, hazing, disparaging labeling, discrimination, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In females shyness is often looked upon as being "pleasantly feminine" and "nice".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The biggest and most consequential difference in the way shyness impacts upon the two genders has to do with the strong social requirement prescribing that <i class="calibre4"> males must assume the assertive role</i> in all manner of social situations. This same norm <i class="calibre4"> proscribes</i> males from assuming the passive role. Today most women have the option of being either assertive or passive. And whereas the normally assertive woman has been found by researchers to stand a better chance at happiness and adjustment than the chronically passive one, the occasional display of passivity rarely causes a woman to suffer highly disparaging or punitive reactions from others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, shyness in women is very rarely found to be coterminus with <i class="calibre4"> loveshyness. </i> In other words, extremely few shy women are <i class="calibre4"> also</i> loveshy. The best available evidence clearly indicates that <i class="calibre4"> shy women</i> <i class="calibre4">are just as likely as non-shy women</i> to date, to get married, and to have children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, shyness does not force women to remain against their wills in the "single, never married" category, as it often does with men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, because loveshyness <i class="calibre4"> (not</i> shyness itself) is very rare among women, this book and the research it incorporates will focus exclusively upon men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to avoid misunderstanding I want to stress the fact that both sexes do suffer from <i class="calibre4"> general shyness</i> about equally. Moreover, there are many different kinds of situations in which shyness is a real problem for some women. However, a young woman's shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex is permitted by our cultural norms to dissipate and fade</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>6 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. Because women are not required <i class="calibre4"> to initiate</i> informal conversations with men, or even with members of their own sex, their future prospects and chances in terms of dating, courtship and marriage are in no way hampered by any psychoemotional inability (shyness) on their part to initiate informal conversations with men. Further, the fact that a woman's success with her all-female peer group is far less dependent upon competitive effectiveness than is a young man's success with <i class="calibre4"> his</i> all-male peer group, assures most women (including very passive ones) of meaningful friendships and of some opportunities for meeting eligible men through female friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many studies have convincingly documented the point that men are far more susceptible than women to severe and intractable loveshyness. For example, in a 1983 study which incorporated a large sample of university students, sociologists David Knox and Kenneth Wilson obtained strong support for the view that loveshyness is primarily a male problem. Fully 20 percent of the male students surveyed complained of painful feelings of shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex in informal social situations. Less than 5 percent of the women students had a similar complaint. And very few of this small minority of women students suffered emotionally from their shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex to the debilitating extent to which the male loveshys suffered from their shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A seldom mentioned factor which I believe serves to increase the shyness (and diminish the self-confidence) of young men as compared to that of young women is the fact that <i class="calibre4"> women</i> do the lion's share of the rejecting in male/female relationships. Within marriage, 90 percent of all divorces are sought by wives and not by husbands. And among courting couples at least two-thirds of all of the breakups which occur are precipitated by the <i class="calibre4"> female</i> partner,  <i class="calibre4"> not</i> by the male partner. In a well-known 1976 study by sociologists Charles Hill, Letitia Peplau, and Zick Rubin, most of the terminated "steady dating" relationships had been terminated by the girl,  <i class="calibre4"> not</i> by the boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even normally self-confident men have been found to suffer far more than women when courtship relationships are terminated. Yet most young men are forced to suffer far more such relationship breakups than women. Such broken relationships very often take a severe emotional toll upon many of the men who suffer them. It is often forgotten that males are human beings with feelings too, every bit as much as females. Yet the relationship terminations which men are forced to endure often create large-scale and often dangerous emotional upheav-als; and some victims of such persistent rejection eventually become so emotionally scarred and calloused that they become incapable of expressing their feelings, even to themselves. Women often complain that men</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>Introduction 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot express their feelings in a meaningful way; yet the steady stream of rejections which some men suffer at the hands of women often creates a <i class="calibre4"> trained incapacity</i> for the expression of inner feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is also important to note that even normally adjusted young men experience significantly <i class="calibre4"> fewer</i> serious man/woman relationships before marriage than (even <i class="calibre4"> very average)</i> young women do. And I think this too bespeaks some of the serious shortcomings in contemporary courtship norms. Human beings do not like to be rejected. It can be extremely painful when a person is rejected by an opposite-sexed stranger upon asking for a date. And it can be profoundly devastating to the emotions when a man is rejected by a woman with whom he has maintained a relationship over several months or longer. Why does the American culture persist in requiring the <i class="calibre4"> male</i> (not the female) to withstand the lion's share of such emotional devastation?! I would suggest that the severe emotional scars endemic in severe and intractable loveshyness very often reflect a history of such rejection. In essence, the risk-taking involved in starting new relationships must be shared equally by women and men alike.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enlightened Self-Control versus Shyness</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, there are many influential people around who do not think loveshyness is a very important problem. In fact, some people even view shyness as a good thing. For example, some view loveshyness as a kind of healthy yoke, tying teenagers and young adults down to the everyday rigors of homework and study. Some people even view loveshyness as a blessing in disguise. They believe that if loveshyness can help to keep young people serious about preparing well for their futures, studying hard, and not getting prematurely pregnant, etc., then this "alleged problem" is really much more of an asset than a liability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Particularly in today's increasingly free sexual atmosphere, many parents and teachers wish that loveshyness would become a great deal more commonplace than it now is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, many people fear <i class="calibre4"> freedom</i> and <i class="calibre4"> choice. </i> Indeed, many people believe that humanity is not sufficiently evolved as yet for its members to be able to responsibly handle very much freedom of choice—</p>
<p class="calibre1">hence, the proliferation in the popularity of very strict, fundamentalistic religious organizations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What such parents and teachers fail to realize is that there is a very big difference between enlightened self-discipline and loveshyness. In tact, loveshyness is the very opposite of self-control. The shy person cannot make choices. The shy person <i class="calibre4"> lacks</i> the self-discipline and self</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>8 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">control necessary for commanding his/her performance in accordance with his/her internalized values and wishes. Again, the shy person lacks free choice and self-determination. He or she is not in the driver's seat of his or her own life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, declining to participate in certain kinds of heterosexual activity because one deliberately and rationally <i class="calibre4"> chooses</i> not to partake in them is perfectly healthy. The making of rational, well-planned decisions is a healthy sign in any person or age group. Choosing to behave in accordance with one's rationally internalized value system is also a healthy sign.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, problems of a very serious nature inevitably arise for those who do not feel that they have any choice in the behavior that they pursue. This is certainly the case for loveshys who avoid many behaviors <i class="calibre4"> not</i> because they have chosen to avoid them, but because the fear of experiencing painful anxiety has effectively blocked them from making and pursuing rational choices about their lives. It is certainly highly desirable for a person to establish values and goals. But for the severely loveshy person, the retaining of values and goals is often little more than an intellectual exercise. Again, the loveshy person is incapable of behaving in accordance with many of his own chosen values and goals because the mere thought of behaving in accordance with them arouses excruciatingly painful feelings of anxiety. This is why in dealing with very shy people it is not possible to correctly infer values and attitudes from observations of behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LoveShyness Is a Serious Problem</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most highly inaccurate misconceptions people have about loveshyness is that it is a problem with little or no bearing upon a person's ultimate life chances. Many people sincerely believe that loveshyness is "just a stage" through which many adolescents quite naturally pass. Unfortunately, the evidence at hand very strongly suggests that most loveshyness victims <i class="calibre4"> do not</i> "just naturally" or spontaneously "outgrow" the problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For most of its victims, loveshyness persists year after year and profoundly affects ultimate life chances. It does this in two ways: First, loveshyness has a major bearing upon the development of interpersonal skills that are of crucial importance for career and personal success. And secondly, loveshyness prevents its victims from developing the networks of informal friendships which are extremely important for the promotion of career effectiveness, community involvement, marriage partner selection, and even for the avoiding of involvement in deviant or self-destructive behavior patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Introduction</p>
<p class="calibre1">9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Christopher Jencks Study</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness and, indeed, the very fact of being without the companionship of a woman has been found to be related to a large host of negative outcomes. For example, Harvard University sociologist Christopher Jencks followed up a large sample of Indiana high school students for ten years—until they were 28 years of age. Among many other things, he compared men and women who had not dated at all while they were in high school with those who had dated. And his findings revealed that the nondaters were far less successful than the daters (1) financially, (2) career-wise, and (3) adjustment-wise, ten years after their high school graduation. Indeed, the more socially active a person had been during his/her high school years, the more successful and happy he/she was likely to be ten years later. Moreover, those young people who had been involved in steady dating relationships while in high school tended to be <i class="calibre4"> best off</i> ten years later in terms of economic and career success.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not surprisingly, these findings were all much stronger for the <i class="calibre4"> men</i> than they were for the women. The socially active women were also better off ten years later than were the women who had been socially inactive while in high school. However, the differences between the socially active and inactive individuals were <i class="calibre4"> far greater for the males than</i> <i class="calibre4">for the females. </i> In other words, the 28-year old men who had not dated at all in high school were found by Jencks and his associates to be the least successful, least happy, least well adjusted individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Informal boy-girl interaction tends to be a highly effective facilitator for the development of interpersonal skills <i class="calibre4"> and social self-confidence</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">attributes which are extremely valuable from the standpoint of career success in today's business world. The frequent daters, for example, had all been actively involved in same-sexed peer networks. Simply put, high school dating both (1) reflects reasonably effective interpersonal skills, and (2) helps to build increasingly higher levels of interpersonal competence and self-confidence. And interpersonal competence is the single, most important correlate of occupational and career success today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, we are beginning to learn that interpersonal skills together with friendship networks represent the single, most effective ticket towards the initial winning and keeping of the best job opportunities.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Studies in the Employment Sector</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Social scientists have learned that better than ninety percent of all employment terminations from white-collar jobs are caused by deficits in interpersonal skills, and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> by technical shortcomings. In fact, among white-collar people who lose their jobs only about one in twelve is terminated for reasons of technical incompetence. The other eleven are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>10 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">"let go" because they are not good team players, because they are less than adequately competent at partaking in the small talk that prevails during coffee breaks, lunch hours, and in the rest rooms. And a very large number of them are "let go" because their supervisors and/or work colleagues feel less than comfortable about having a work mate who withdraws too much or who is not adequately relaxed and naturally sociable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another little-known fact is that about 70 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> best job and</i> <i class="calibre4">career opportunities</i> are obtained "under the table"  <i class="calibre4"> through informal social</i> <i class="calibre4">networks. </i> Quite in spite of "Affirmative Action" and "Equal Opportunity Employment", only about 30 percent of the better job opportunities are obtained through such traditional sources as newspaper job ads, personnel offices, employment agencies, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Moreover, recent studies have shown that compared to jobs obtained the regular ways, jobs obtained through informal social networks (1) pay significantly better, (2) provide far better growth opportunities, (3) are about three times more likely to provide high levels of career satisfaction, and (4) are about five times more likely to be retained by the incumbent for ten or more years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Research evidence also shows that among people of approximately the same education and technical training, employers are most likely to be disarmed by the warm, relaxed, naturally sociable job applicant. The incumbent of any position who has an easy-going, natural command of strong interpersonal skills and finesse is the one who is (1) likely to be promoted the fastest, and (2) who is least likely to be laid off when things get tough.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, several studies have shown that deficits in actual job performance are a good deal more likely to be overlooked and forgiven in socially effective people. In essence, the person with strong social skills and social self-confidence (non-shyness) is accorded many more chances to prove himself than is the shy, retiring person who commonly avoids informal social intercourse. Indeed, the latter type person often makes work mates feel uncomfortable. And a technical error that would easily be overlooked or forgiven in the friendly, highly sociable employee is often viewed as cause for termination in the shy and retiring employee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for a person to belong to informal social networks he must be a relaxed, easy-to-get-to-know, sociable person. Further, he must be a person of at least average interpersonal skills relative to his chronological age and education/economic status group. The experience of dating has long been known to be instrumental in promoting these social skills and personal qualities. Moreover, very rare indeed is the young man who is popular with women but unpopular among members of his own gender. Indeed, the all-male peer group has long been known to be extremely important in terms of introducing its members to suitable</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Introduction</p>
<p class="calibre1">11</p>
<p class="calibre1">female partners and in terms of promoting informal dating and courtship activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, ours is a <i class="calibre4"> coeducational world. </i> To an increasing extent women are successfully permeating all sectors of the work force, and this trend can be expected to continue unabated. A male who has not learned to feel at home with women can surely anticipate encountering a never-ending array of anxiety-provoking situations whenever he is involved either within the world of employment or in the process of obtaining same.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">On Remedying Social Skill Deficits</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a well established fact that deficits in interpersonal skills are much, much more difficult for a person to remedy in later life than are deficits in intellectual/technical skills. A person can successfully accumulate book learning at <i class="calibre4"> any</i> time of life once he or she has made the commitment. In contrast, the correction of deficits in interpersonal skills is extremely difficult to bring about, no matter how dedicated the commitment to learning might be. This is why at the elementary school level and beyond, the cultivation of socioemotional interpersonal skills is of far greater importance from the standpoint of ultimate success and happiness than is the cultivation of intellectual skills. At <i class="calibre4"> any age</i> any person of normal intelligence can develop technical or intellectual competence from exposure to books and classroom instruction. Sadly, the cultivation of expressive social skills <i class="calibre4"> cannot</i> be effected through book learning, nor can it be accomplished like intellectual learning at just any time of life.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Early Marriage versus Professional Success</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Columbia University sociologist Ely Ginzberg published a related study in which he had followed up for some fifteen years a large group of medical school graduates. Over that period of time all of the doctors studied had achieved a considerable amount of professional success. But Ginzberg found that one of the strongest <i class="calibre4"> and least expected</i> predictors of career success was the age at which a doctor had married. Most Americans have long operated under the ascetic assumption that one of the sacrifices a person must make in order to become a medical doctor is that of <i class="calibre4"> delayed marriage. </i> NOT SO, according to Ginzberg's findings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ginzberg divided the doctors up into thirds in terms of how successful they were fifteen years after graduation from medical school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was the most successful one-third, the least successful one-third, and the third that was in the middle in terms of career success. In a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>12</p>
<p class="calibre1">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">nutshell, the most successful one-third had married <i class="calibre4"> earliest in life, </i> whereas the least successful one-third had married <i class="calibre4"> latest. </i> Indeed, several of the least successful one-third had not married at all, whereas none of the <i class="calibre4">most</i> successful one-third had remained unmarried. Moreover, a majority of the most successful doctors had married while they were still in their junior or senior year of undergraduate work, or while they were in their first two years of medical school training.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, early marriage does not assure strong interpersonal skills. However, the evidence from the research of Jencks, Ginzberg, and many others, strongly suggests that early, successful heterosexual interaction does lead to the kind of social skills and social self-confidence that is as valuable in the world of employment as it is within the context of an individual's personal life.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Dating and General Happiness</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy male of any age can usually think of little else apart from the mental-emotional prison which blocks him from making meaningful contact with that which he most sorely wants and needs— <i class="calibre4">girlsl</i> This fact was driven home to me several years ago in a study I conducted on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. This study dealt with the relationship between personality traits and all aspects of student behavior. A representative sample of over 300 students was taken, and thousands of correlation figures were obtained. A correlation coefficient is simply a barometer as to how strongly or closely two factors are associated with each other. Of the thousands of correlation coefficients my study produced, the strongest one of all was the one relating the following two variables:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a. Degree of personal satisfaction and contentment with the amount of informal boy/girl interaction engaged in of late.</p>
<p class="calibre1">b. General happiness with life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put,  <i class="calibre4"> nothing</i> in the entire study correlated more strongly with happiness and general sense of well-being than did extent of satisfaction with amount of informal boy/girl interaction. The correlation between these two factors was + .65 for the young men and + .32 for the young women. A related correlation coefficient dealt with the relationship between <i class="calibre4"> general happiness</i> and <i class="calibre4"> number of dates</i> averaged per month with the opposite sex. And this correlation figure was similarly far above average by social science standards: it was + .49 for male students and</p>
<p class="calibre1">+ .16 for the female students. Thus we have another clear indication of the fact that girls are far more important to men than men are to girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>Introduction 13</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is commonplace for moralists to disparage happiness as something which is "overemphasized" in America, and as something which is alleged to be not a very important end goal. To be sure, happiness cannot successfully be sought directly. Happiness is, in essence, a natural byproduct of (1) making effective progress within the sorts of socially valued activities that are most germane to a person's prime goals in life, and (2) active involvement in networks of meaningful <i class="calibre4"> (love</i> and <i class="calibre4"> work)</i> roles and relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, happiness is <i class="calibre4"> very important</i> in a whole host of ways about which ascetic moralists are invariably blind. Research evidence has shown that (1) happiness is a prerequisite for self-love, and that (2) self-love is a prerequisite for a loving, caring attitude towards others. Unhappy people are in a very poor position to be of genuine service to their fellow man. And there is a kind of vicious circle here because it is only through service to humanity that a person can achieve maximum happiness and contentment. However, a person's own cup must be adequately filled before he can begin to share the contents of his cup with other people. The cup of a loveshy male quite typically has very little in it. And as this book will clearly demonstrate, loveshy males of all ages are often profoundly unhappy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is the happiness and contentment of males so much more strongly influenced by successful heterosexual interaction than that of females? Most researchers today believe that the answer rests on the fact that women tend to be capable of finding emotionally intimate companionship vis-a-vis their own sex whereas men are able to satisfy their needs for emotional intimacy only in the company of women. Furthermore, nondating females can normally manage to develop and maintain their socioemotional social skills and social self-confidence in their all-female peer groups. In contrast, nondating males are usually isolated from social networks involving same-sexed peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Love as a Powerful Elixir</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Further testimony as to the highly deleterious consequences of loveshyness can be seen in work that has come out of the U.C.L.A.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"love laboratory". It seems that there is a very big difference <i class="calibre4"> (especially</i> <i class="calibre4">for men)</i> between being involved in a love relationship wherein there is actual interaction between the man and the woman and the two people love each other about equally, and the sort of <i class="calibre4"> unrequited</i> "love" situation where either (1) the boy loves the girl and she is not even aware of his existence, or (2) the boy loves the girl a great deal more than she loves him. The latter situation might best be described as <i class="calibre4"> infatuation, </i> rather</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>14 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">than "love". And it has been found to be especially commonplace among the ranks of loveshy males of all ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such romantic infatuation in the absence of real interaction and sharing tends to be associated with such classic symptomology as loss of appetite, insomnia, inability to concentrate on work or studies, behavioral instability, a sharp dropping off in grades at school, inefficiency, uncooperativeness, the need to walk or run around the town aimlessly, and the need to walk (or run) around all day long in a stuporous world of daydreams and fantasy. This is the type of symptomology which poets down through the ages have associated with "being in love"—a fact which suggests that many classic poets may well have been seriously loveshy themselves. Indeed, poets very often are "dreamers" rather than "doers", and chronic dreaming about the same theme is normally a reflection of wish-fulfillment—of a way of coping with a problematical void in everyday living.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast, the U.C.L.A. love researchers found <i class="calibre4"> mutual</i> love relationships to be associated with a dramatically different kind of symptomology. Young men who were actively involved in <i class="calibre4"> mutual</i> love relationships (wherein the girl interacted with and loved the young man in return) tended to be fired up with an intense vibrancy, exuberance, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">"aliveness" that even the best adjusted among them had never known before. This vibrancy and natural enthusiasm was associated with (1) <i class="calibre4"> better</i> grades in school, (2) an increased capacity to deeply concentrate when they did sit down to study, (3) better and more efficient use of time, (4) <i class="calibre4"> increased</i> participation in social activities with <i class="calibre4"> their own</i> gender, (5) an improved appetite, (6) an increased ability to sleep soundly when they did go to bed, (7) an ability to remain effective with less sleep than they had required prior to falling in love, (8) better health, (9) increased atten-tiveness to all facets of personal appearance and grooming, and (10) an outward appearance and general ambiance that made their friends and acquaintances view them as looking better, more alive and vibrant, than they had formerly known them to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important findings to emerge from this "love laboratory" research was that (1) men who were involved in a geniunely reciprocated love relationship tended to have an extremely bright, very strong Kirlian aura, whereas (2) men who were involved in unreciprocated <i class="calibre4"> infatuations</i> tended to have a very weak, "sick" kind of Kirlian aura of a type commonplace among severe neurotics, hypoglycemics, and some schizophrenics.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Thelma Moss is one of America's most respected psi researchers. Specializing in Kirlian Photography, which is a form of electrical photography which permits the photographing of the human aura</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Introduction 15</p>
<p class="calibre1">(sometimes called the <i class="calibre4"> etheric</i> or <i class="calibre4"> bioplasmic body), </i> Dr. Moss had her laboratory in the same U.C.L.A. building as that which contained the "love laboratory". And she took full advantage of the opportunity to photograph the Kirlian auras of (1) those in reciprocated love, (2) those not in love, and (3) those involved in unrequited, unreciprocated infatuations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Involvement in a reciprocal love relationship was found to benefit women in much the same ways that it benefitted men. And this included the Kirlian aura. However, the findings were substantially weaker for the women than they were for the men. Certainly the experience of being in love did not harm any of the women studied. But being in love tended to have a much more nearly neutral impact upon the women subjects than it had upon the male subjects. On the other hand, in one significant respect the women studied were better off than the men: In particular, women were found to be substantially less vulnerable than men towards becoming involved in nonproductive, non-reciprocal romantic infatuations of the sort which the researchers found to give rise to the first quite negative set of symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, when women did become involved in unreciprocated romantic infatuations, the effect upon their Kirlian aura was minimal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, unrequited love tended to very adversely affect the corona of a young man's Kirlian aura; the effect of unrequited love feelings upon a woman's aura tended to be minimal. On the other hand, being involved in a <i class="calibre4"> real</i> love relationship tended to galvanize a young man's Kirlian corona into a brilliant, full-bodied glow. The effect of such a love relationship upon a young woman's Kirlian aura was also noticeably positive. But the effect was substantially less dramatic than what had obtained for the men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, becoming involved in a <i class="calibre4"> genuine</i> love relationship appears to constitute an extremely beneficial, life-enhancing medicine for young men. The love experience is at once a kind of elixir of life, a sort of fountain of youth and of vibrant aliveness and of masculine effectiveness. It might also be seen as representing the richest form of fertilizer for the cultivation of social self-confidence and expressive interpersonal skills. Besides being immediately life-enhancing, such positive outcomes are bound to exert a positive impact upon a man's lifetime productivity and general effectiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Premarital Virginity and Adjustment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Premarital virginity in males over the age of 20 is often a reflection of severe loveshyness and of interpersonal skill deficits. And this is exactly what sociologist Mirra Komarovsky found in her sample of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>16 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Columbia University men. For example, she found that fully <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of the virginal university men fell <i class="calibre4"> below</i> the 50th percentile on national <i class="calibre4">self-confidence</i> norms. In contrast, this was true for only 34 percent of the sexually experienced men. Fully 78 percent of her non-virginal men scored above the 50th percentile (national norms) on <i class="calibre4"> leadership capacity,</i> compared to only 47 percent of the virgins. On <i class="calibre4"> sociability</i> 71 percent of the sexually experienced men scored above the 50th percentile on national norms, compared to only 27 percent of the virginal men. And on <i class="calibre4"> self-acceptance</i> only a mere 2 percent of her non-virginal Columbia University men scored below the 50th percentile on national norms. In stark contrast, fully 47 percent of the virginal men scored below the 50th percentile on self-acceptance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now to be sure, premarital sex (monogamous <i class="calibre4"> or</i> promiscuous) does not <i class="calibre4"> cause</i> a person to become self-confident, self-accepting, sociable, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The cause of these findings rests upon the <i class="calibre4"> goodness of fit</i> between (1) a person's behavior, and (2) how that person thinks and feels about his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her behavior. For example, twenty-five years ago most studies showed a <i class="calibre4"> negative</i> relationship for single women between non-virginity and self-esteem. In other words, the sexually experienced ones usually did not think as highly of themselves as did those who had managed to preserve their virginity. Today, on the other hand, most studies are showing that for single women as well as men (beyond the age of 19), there is a <i class="calibre4"> positive</i> relationship between monogamous premarital sexual experience and level of self-esteem. This positive relationship is usually found to be a good deal stronger for single males than for single females—because sexual experience is usually a good deal more important to the emotional needs and to the value systems of single men than it is to single women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the statistical association between self-esteem and sexual experience has become positive nowadays for both genders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, young women (and even men) who are very casual and "loose" in their premarital sexual activity usually have poorer self-images than those whose premarital sex is kept monogamous and faithful. In other words, monogamous, loving, contraceptively protected premarital sexual activity is usually found in today's research studies to be associated with the most favorable results as far as self-esteem in both sexes is concerned. However, even the more promiscuous young men have usually been found to enjoy higher overall levels of self-esteem than young men who remain quite socially inactive (as well as virginal) as far as informal man/woman interaction is concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think the major reason for these findings is that virtually all heterosexually oriented young men <i class="calibre4"> want</i> to have someone of the opposite sex to love. Those young men who continue much beyond the age of 20 shy of this goal (which is important to them from the standpoint</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Introduction 17</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their own stated <i class="calibre4"> values and goals)</i> are bound to develop increasingly poorer self-images and increasingly lower levels of self-esteem. Premarital sexmaking itself is of considerably less importance than it is commonly made out to be. I have become convinced that premarital sexmaking (including coitus) is a natural byproduct and concomitant of being enmeshed in the right man/woman love relationship. Hence, those without premarital coital experience are less likely than people with such experience to have ever savored the joy of being involved in what for a time at least had been "the right relationship".</p>
<p class="calibre1">I fully realize that there are young men and women "out there"</p>
<p class="calibre1">whose value systems prohibit premarital sexual activity. This comparatively small minority of young people will be able to sustain strong, healthy self-images without premarital sex <i class="calibre4"> if and only if they too manage</i> <i class="calibre4">to experience the joy of being involved in what for them is "the right man/woman</i> <i class="calibre4">relationship". </i> In short, the sense of personal freedom (non-shyness) necessary for obtaining a love relationship is every bit as important to the emotional well-being of religiously conservative young people as it is to that of religiously more moderate to liberal ones. The latter will incorporate premarital sex into their love relationships; the former will be less likely to do so. However,  <i class="calibre4"> both</i> types of young people (especially <i class="calibre4"> males)</i> need to be able to relax and to enjoy informal, friendly interaction with the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Viewing Someone to Love as a Cure-all</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy males are often accused of thinking that if they only had a girl to love all of their problems would be solved. I believe that this sort of viewpoint deserves comment early on in this book. Clinical psychologists and counselors often feel that the loveshy have not taken the time to properly assess the nature of their situation. My own work with the loveshy has convinced me that most shy people are, if anything, far <i class="calibre4"> too introspective. </i> They are constantly thinking and worrying about all conceivable facets of their situation. And this represents a significant aspect of their difficulties. In essence, shy people think too much about the wrong things, and always with negative mental imagery and negative affirmations. Since they lack informal support (friendship) groups and since they are almost constantly alone, there is nothing in their social field to provide positive feedback and to distract their negative thought and imagery towards positive directions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of the evidence thus far cited, it should be clear that meaningful female companionship and love <i class="calibre4"> IS ITSELF A POWERFUL</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">CAUSAL AGENT. </i> It is, in a word, a kind of <i class="calibre4"> medicine</i> even for healthy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>18 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">men, much less for disordered ones! The conclusion seems inescapable that many of the personal problems from which loveshy men suffer are due <i class="calibre4"> at least in part</i> to the leading of isolated, loveless lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moralists perceive female companionship for men strictly in terms of its being <i class="calibre4"> AN EFFECT or reward</i> for "taking the bull by the horns" and thus expurgating whatever problems that might have been suffered. In essence, moralistic psychotherapists do not recognize love as a <i class="calibre4"> CAUSE</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a <i class="calibre4"> prime mover. </i> And in another less obvious sense this moralistic viewpoint is ridiculous: <i class="calibre4"> Everybody</i> has at least some problems to contend with every day of their lives. When a person stops having problems he/she is dead!</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the outset I would insist that it is <i class="calibre4"> inconceivable</i> that involvement in a meaningful love relationship with a woman would not benefit a loveshy man, even to the point of ridding him of a significant portion of his many problems. As the data presented in this book will make clear,  <i class="calibre4"> almost all</i> of a loveshy man's problems are a direct result of loveshyness. LOVE IS A <i class="calibre4"> CAUSE</i> AS WELL AS A CONSEQUENCE. Down through human history there has nearly always been a woman behind virtually every successful man. Indeed, this is so true that it has become a popular cliche.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the reader wends his/her way through the chapters which follow he/she will observe that in almost every instance the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshy men are worse off in their many problems than the younger ones. Having been without the meaningful love/compassion of a woman for a significantly greater length of time, it logically follows that they would be worse off. Heterosexual love is a great medicine and healing elixir. And this is why I believe that it would greatly benefit society to pull out the stops (1) in getting its loveshy members healed of their loveshyness, and (2) in getting all people involved in meaningful social networks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness represents a horrendous waste of valuable human resources.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, anyone who would jump precipitously into marriage under the assumption that marriage would solve all of his problems would obviously be headed for trouble. However, as this book will make clear, loveshy men have a considerably below average susceptibility towards taking overly hasty actions. Indeed, if anything they are vulnerable towards acting <i class="calibre4"> far too slowly</i> for their own good!</p>
<p class="calibre1">For many years now family sociologists have been advising the public that courtships of less than 24-months duration are much more likely to eventuate in unsuccessful marriages than those which last for more than 24 months. Today neither the loveshy nor the non-shy need to actually be married in order to enjoy intimate and thoroughgoing involvement in all facets of their loved one's life. They can "go steady"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and/or they can premaritally cohabit as opposite sexed roommates and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Introduction 19</p>
<p class="calibre1">lovers. Therapists who tell their loveshy clients that marriage won't solve all their problems need to remain cognizant of the fact that courtship <i class="calibre4"> precedes</i> marriage and serves as a <i class="calibre4"> screening device</i> for same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the "going steady" and the premarital cohabitation can and should serve as a testing ground that is preliminary to marriage. It should assure (1) that when lovers do make the final leap into marriage they are taking the right step. Finally (2) , such courtship processes should clearly indicate to a person just exactly what problems are likely to be healed or alleviated by active involvement in a love relationship, and just exactly what personal problems may not be healed or affected by participation in a meaningful love relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Is having someone to love a cure-all? Obviously not! Indeed, nothing can ever be viewed as a panacea for all of life's problems. However, for the loveshy I would suggest that the obtaining of someone to love comes closer than anything else ever could to representing a potential near-panacea.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember that <i class="calibre4"> the law of the Lord is love</i>— <i class="calibre4">and compassion! </i> This is the single most important message of the Christian Bible. And it is the one idea promulgated by organized religion to which we would all do well to pay heed—even though religionists seem to be as likely as anyone to forget this enormously important message.  <i class="calibre4"> Love is the great healer. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Defined in terms of a deep and sincere caring and concern for the needs and the feelings of others,  <i class="calibre4"> LOVE</i> can heal almost any wound and it can solve virtually any and all personal and social problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly, I would say that it is both <i class="calibre4"> insensitive</i> and <i class="calibre4"> unloving</i> for a therapist to continually remind his/her loveshy client that "a love relationship won't solve all of a person's problems", and that "love is not a panacea". Such reminders constitute superfluous tautologies; and they have the effect of placing the loveshy client on the defensive. In other words, such reminders represent formidable roadblocks to communication and to therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most sensible and viable programs for both <i class="calibre4"> remediating</i> and <i class="calibre4">preventing</i> loveshyness are those which are focused specifically upon the goal of getting and assuring <i class="calibre4"> all</i> people of the love that they need.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When this goal is ultimately achieved, we shall all enjoy the benefit of living in a far better, safer, healthier and more secure world than the one which we currently have available to us.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Normative Timetables of Self-Revelation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In America as in all western societies there are unwritten rules governing how early in a heterosexual love relationship each party may reveal himself/herself to the other. Early in a relationship a person <i class="calibre4"> (if</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>20 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">he/she is to ultimately be successful in winning the partner) must be both willing and able to <i class="calibre4"> wear a mask, </i> metaphorically speaking—to <i class="calibre4"> play</i> <i class="calibre4">act, </i> and to assiduously try to "be" something other than what he/she truly is. Both partners will try to impress the other. The man will try to present himself vis-a-vis his girl as a masculine "he-man" who is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"regular guy", into sports, athletics, body-building, and the other endeavors which inside America accompany the prototypical masculine stereotype. The girl partner will similarly try to present herself as a prototypical female with all the "normal" attributes of the "ideal" female stereotype.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It requires quite a bit of <i class="calibre4"> "work" </i> and <i class="calibre4"> effort</i> in order to be able to do this. Moreover, since it involves play acting (of a sort towards which the participants are scarcely even aware), it is <i class="calibre4"> less than honest. </i> The person is not presenting his/her <i class="calibre4"> real self</i> vis-a-vis the partner. The norms prevent this completely honest and open presentation of self until the relationship has reached a certain point of maturity. Among college/university aged young people, it usually requires around six months of "steady dating" of the love-partner before this point is reached. Among high school students more than a year would be required; among junior high schoolers the amount of time required could well be over two years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divorcees in their thirties have an advantage here inasmuch as these very strong and demanding (unwritten rules/norms) permit older daters to "remove their masks" and to present their <i class="calibre4"> real</i> selves vis-a-vis each other as early as the second, third, or fourth date.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> extremely</i> romantic and sentimental. This sort of play-acting (which is <i class="calibre4"> absolutely required</i> by our courtship system) represents an abomination to them. They want to find someone who will accept and love them <i class="calibre4"> as they are. </i> And when they spot someone with the appropriate (and much desired) long hair and pretty face, they strongly desire to intimate their very strong interest in marriage vis-a-vis that person as early in the relationship as possible. In short, they don't want to beat around the bush. Dating and courtship for loveshy men hold no special allure. Most loveshy men would love to completely bypass the <i class="calibre4"> "game" </i> of dating and courtship, and get right into a permanent, binding relationship with their romantic image of the girl with the "long hair and pretty face".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, such outright candor early in a relationship enormously scares and frightens away most women—particularly the attractive ones who are likely to be very much used to the <i class="calibre4"> "game" </i> of dating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy man is thus viewed as "weird" for verbalizing himself and his true desires and fantasies too early in a relationship. (And usually he does this through letter-writing rather than through talk. Again, letter-writing is far easier for the loveshy man to handle. But this too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>Introduction 21</p>
<p class="calibre1">is likely to be regarded by the woman as "weird"—especially if she is but a local telephone call away from the loveshy man.) Further, loveshys usually renounce aspects of the masculine sex-role stereotype. Loveshy men hate football, baseball, basketball, weight-lifting, beer-drinking, swearing and carousing with same-sexed associates, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> They are far more likely to be interested in "settling down", and in the sorts of things women are likely to be interested in. Again, such honest and open self-revelation frightens women away when it occurs early on in a relationship. Moreover, expressed disinterest in and hostility towards prototypically "masculine" sex-role stereotypical activities and interests is also quite likely to be regarded by an attractive young woman as "weird" and strange. A less-than-attractive woman might be charmed by this approach—because she too hasn't got many same-sexed friends and thus similarly lacks a full awareness of what the rules of the dating "game" are. But as I have documented in chapter 12, loveshy men (because they are deeply and unshakably romantic) are extremely <i class="calibre4"> visual; </i> they do not permit themselves to become involved in conversations with women who are less than very attractive and who do not possess the "long hair and pretty face".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course,  <i class="calibre4"> awareness</i> of the dating game rules and <i class="calibre4"> acceptance</i> of same are two entirely different things. Many loveshys are aware of the rules, but their unadulterated romanticism disallows them from accepting such rules and acting upon them. Again, loveshy men value complete hon-esty. They want to remove the play-acting "mask" immediately, as soon as they find themselves engaged in a conversation with a pretty girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They crave and aspire to immediate acceptance and love <i class="calibre4"> as they are</i>—no false "fronts" presented.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Why This Book? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Shy people tend to be very quiet. This is why they are often labeled</p>
<p class="calibre1">"wall-flowers". And it represents a key reason why they have been accorded very little attention by research scholars, by popular journalists, and by people in general. Shy people are simply not noticed, and this fact applies as much to the loveshy as it does to any other kind of shy person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now only one popular, research-based account has been published on shyness. And this was Philip Zimbardo's (1977) book titled SHYNESS: WHAT IT IS AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. Dr. Zimbardo's book remains worth reading. However, its usefulness is severely limited by four basic shortcomings.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>22 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) General Shyness</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, Zimbardo's work dealt with <i class="calibre4"> generic</i> shyness. Further, he dealt with shyness in a very <i class="calibre4"> general</i> kind of way, painting a picture of the problem for us in very broad strokes. As I pointed out in the preceding section,  <i class="calibre4"> love</i>-shyness is the most emotionally debilitating and painful of all the different forms of shyness. And because of the requirement in male/female situations that the <i class="calibre4"> male partner</i> must always be the one to make the first move (1) in initiating social contacts, (2) in the risk-taking of asking for first dates, and (3) in initiating physical expressions of affection, I determined that <i class="calibre4"> loveshyness</i> is a problem that is suffered primarily and almost exclusively by the male sex. After many years of studying the shyness problems of women, it became clear to me that <i class="calibre4">love</i>-shyness was very seldom among them, and that it would be most fruitful to focus upon loveshyness in the male sex only.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, this book focuses entirely and exclusively upon <i class="calibre4"> love</i>-shyness, and it deals exclusively with <i class="calibre4"> male</i> victims of the problem. Throughout all the pages of his book Dr. Zimbardo scarcely even mentions shyness in informal male/female situations. Hence, his book would have to be considered of very limited value from the standpoint of the needs of those with an interest in this most life-debilitating of all forms of shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) <i class="calibre4"> Sampling</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Zimbardo simply asked each of his respondents: "Do you consider yourself to be a shy person?" And slightly better than 40 percent of his respondents said "yes", whereas the other 60 percent said "no".</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in looking for the causal antecedents of the shyness problem he simply compared the social and family backgrounds of the "shy" 40</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent with those of the "non-shy" 60 percent. Not surprisingly, he came up with next to nothing. In short, the family and social backgrounds of the "shys" were essentially the same in nature as those of the "non-shys". "Shy people" could be found in varying proportions among all demographic categories, and in every geographic area. And it was found to be most commonplace in Japan, and least commonplace in Israel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The conclusion to be drawn from all of this was obvious: <i class="calibre4"> shyness</i> <i class="calibre4">is learned. </i> Nobody is ever born shy. And another inevitable conclusion was: teach people (1) that shyness is learned, and (2) how to go about unlearning (extinguishing) it. These conclusions were, in essence, all too pat and frought with holes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, 40 percent represents a huge fraction of the population. Virtually any statistician will agree that if you compare 40 percent of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>Introduction 23</p>
<p class="calibre1">population with the other 60 percent <i class="calibre4"> on ANY variable, </i> you will get no significant difference between the two groups for that variable. In other words, the family backgrounds (including socialization practices, dis-ciline, etc.) of <i class="calibre4"> ANY</i> 40 percent of the population will not differ appre-ciably from those of the other 60 percent. It makes no difference whether you choose shyness, degree of religiosity, political liberality versus conservatism, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> The chance that statistically meaningful differences will obtain between groups that are so large is virtually nil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for real differences to be obtained between two groups, and in order for the actual causes of shyness to be isolated, the term</p>
<p class="calibre1">"shyness" would need to be much more carefully defined and delimited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not surprising that 40 percent of the American population feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">"shy" from time to time. In fact, Dr. Zimbardo tells us that fully 85</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of Americans admit to having been "shy"  <i class="calibre4"> at some point</i> in their lives. And that too is far from surprising. What needs to be stressed, however, is that very few of this huge number of people have a life-debilitating form of shyness. Very few of them suffer from the sort of chronic shyness that is so painful that free choice and self-determination are effectively blocked. For example, 40 percent of the male population does not remain involuntarily unmarried throughout their lives on account of severe shyness!</p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is concerned with just that very life-debilitating, severely painful form of shyness. What is more, it is concerned with a specific form of severe shyness that prevents a person from partaking in the normal round of dating, courtship, marriage and family activities. In short, this book is concerned with a form of shyness that is so strong that it serves to <i class="calibre4"> prevent</i> a normally heterosexual person from ever having sex and getting married, and from ever being able to savor the joys and satisfactions of membership inside a family of his own making.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Defined in these terms, we are certainly not talking about 40 percent of the population! We are talking about roughly 1.5 percent of the American male population, or about 1,670,000 American males. When 1.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the male population is compared against a healthy group without this loveshyness problem, significant differences do show up in great abundance. Moreover, many of these differences have a strong bearing upon the question of what <i class="calibre4"> causes</i> loveshyness. Further, that quite sizable chunk of the American population with less severe and debilitating forms of loveshyness should be permitted by the findings delineated in this book to gain considerable valuable insight into themselves and their problems. In addition, everyone who reads this book will become much better equipped than they had been to effectively <i class="calibre4">prevent all</i> degrees of shyness (both mild and severe) from ever developing in the lives of their loved ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>24 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) <i class="calibre4"> Nature versus Nurture</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Zimbardo is a learning psychologist. And like most psychologists whose careers have focused almost exclusively upon learning processes and upon laboratory experimentation, Dr. Zimbardo has remained abysmally unaware and unaffected by the burgeoning research literature on the biological basis of shyness. This literature includes material on genetics, congenital factors, human physiology, and human biochemistry. And in recent years the message of this literature has become strong and consistent. In essence, shyness itself is indeed learned; but severe and chronic forms of it are learned primarily as a direct result of two dimensions of temperament called <i class="calibre4"> inhibition</i> and <i class="calibre4"> emotionality</i> (low anxiety threshold) which <i class="calibre4"> ARE INBORN</i> and genetically rooted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As author of this book I have an extensive knowledge and understanding of BOTH kinds of research literature: (1) that which has focused upon learning,  <i class="calibre4"> AND</i> (2) that which has focused upon inborn, biologically based considerations. The extensive bibliography that is provided at the end of this book should provide the reader with some idea of the <i class="calibre4"> balanced</i> <i class="calibre4">perspective</i> which this book has endeavored to represent. I firmly believe that therapists with a one-sided perspective cannot and will not succeed in remedying any but the most mild cases of shyness. Zimbardo himself admits that he helps only 50 percent of the people who seek help at his</p>
<p class="calibre1">"shyness clinic". Such a therapeutic success record is not very impressive (1) because a 50 percent cure rate could be obtained by pure chance, and (2) because with very few exceptions the young men and women who seek help at his clinic suffer from only very mild degrees of shyness.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Dr. Zimbardo's book, this book will endeavor to provide the reader with a truly balanced perspective on the causal antecedents of shyness. My approach will in no way underestimate the prime importance of social learning—particularly that which goes on inside the contexts of the family and the peer group. However, I will similarly not underestimate what I consider to be the even greater importance of <i class="calibre4"> inborn</i> factors. The inborn factors constitute a set of <i class="calibre4"> elastic limits. </i> They set the stage for and limit that which can be learned. And even though there is no shyness gene, those born with the <i class="calibre4"> "inhibition/emotionality gene" </i> are far more likely, as this book will show, to develop and learn loveshyness—here within the context of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, there is a third class of variables falling outside the purview of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> "nature"  <i class="calibre4"> and</i> "nurture" which up to now Zimbardo and most other psychologists have totally ignored. These variables might best be termed <i class="calibre4"> occult. </i> And a balanced perspective on shyness <i class="calibre4"> must</i> take these into account along with variables pertinent to learning and to biological, inborn considerations. As this book will show, not all "occult" variables</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Introduction 25</p>
<p class="calibre1">are non-amenable to empirical analysis. In essence, many occult factors have been studied through the use of the five physical senses. And this book will discuss these variables and the important implications which they may entail for the development of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Man is far more than merely a physical body. The physical body is merely the <i class="calibre4"> vehicle</i> for man's immortal spirit at the earth (incarnate) level of energy vibration. Severe loveshyness can be seen as a byproduct of a synergistic interaction between and among (1) inborn factors, (2) learning factors, and (3) spiritual/occult factors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) <i class="calibre4"> Advice to the Shy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lacking a balanced perspective on how shyness develops, Zimbardo's book is less than understanding or insightful in the way it doles out advice and recommendations to victims of the problem. In essence, it tells people without any "bootstraps" to go out and "pick themselves up by their own bootstraps." Most of the loveshy men I interviewed who had read Zimbardo's book had emerged quite depressed and exasperated by the experience. The book was allegedly the first to be written about <i class="calibre4"> their</i> problem. And yet the loveshy men I talked to could not relate to Zimbardo's therapeutic and preventive recommendations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, they saw his "therapeutic" recommendations, in particular, as being a <i class="calibre4"> sham</i> as well as highly insensitive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A major purpose of this book is to provide recommendations for both therapy and prevention which are realistic and meaningful to those afflicted with severe loveshyness problems. Perhaps more than anything else (other than a suitable lover), the loveshy need a <i class="calibre4"> spokesman. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, they need support groups with some political influence and power—groups which will effectively move them towards their goals of marriage and a satisfying family life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This book is based upon extensive interviews with 300 severely loveshy men. Each of these 300 men represents a case of genuine, life-debilitating shyness. All have been effectively prevented from dating, marrying, having sex, informally interacting with women, etc., by their loveshyness problem. And all have been bogged down by shyness throughout the entirety of their respective life spans. The recommendations that are made in this book are to the maximum extent possible sensitive to the needs, wishes and very real human feelings of these men. Furthermore, this book contains no recommendations or pieces of advice that are out of harmony with what has been learned about the inborn, biologically based attributes of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, readers who are loveshy should feel heartened to learn that there are plenty of attractive female partners around who would be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>26 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite amenable to loving a loveshy man. This book will present a therapeutic approach which can be engineered <i class="calibre4"> now, </i> which is already available in diluted form on certain university campuses, and which can and will assure each and every loveshy man of a female lover. This is an approach which can and will accomplish this goal <i class="calibre4"> without</i> requiring the loveshy to perform any anxiety-provoking "homework" exercises, such as <i class="calibre4"> starting conversations with strangers. </i> Zimbardo's approach requires the loveshy to confront and deal with excruciatingly painful anxiety feelings. This book, in contrast, recognizes that it is unreasonable to require anyone to "walk on fire" in order to be healed. In essence, this book does not prescribe any anxiety-provoking exercises for the loveshy, nor does it recommend any costly and exasperating "talking cure" based upon insight or so-called unconscious motivation. No loveshy man was ever cured as a result of talking to a psychotherapist over months and years of time!</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further problem with Zimbardo's approach to therapy is that he endeavors to treat people with all manner of different kinds and degrees of shyness. And this represents a key reason why loveshy men cannot relate to much of what Zimbardo has to say. For example, it has long been known that alcoholics cannot be helped through participating in therapy groups that are composed of people suffering from a wide variety of different sorts of psychoemotional problems. On the other hand, as soon as they are introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous groups most alcoholics begin deriving significant benefits almost immediately. I believe that the loveshy are similar to alcoholics in this regard. They need and require therapy groups that are focused specifically and exclusively upon heterosexual loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most loveshy men feel very different from the majority of clients who partake in Zimbardo's "shyness clinic" therapy programs. Most loveshy men don't really much care if they <i class="calibre4"> never</i> become capable of starting conversations with strangers, or delivering informal talks before large groups of people, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i>  <i class="calibre4"> All they really want is a girl! </i> And all else is nothing more than an abrasively irritating distraction which they would much prefer to do without. To be sure,  <i class="calibre4"> after</i> they have found a girl most loveshy men might well be expected to become tolerant and patient enough to recognize the desirability of working on <i class="calibre4"> other</i> shyness-related problems. But unless and until they have found their girl, these other shyness-related problems have just about as much significance to loveshy men as the falling of a leaf in a distant forest. They are simply not interested in other shyness-related difficulties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Zimbardo's attitude towards shy people is quite moralistic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this book I take pains to avoid intimating any moralistic or judgmental attitudes towards the loveshy. It has been my experience that a moralistic attitude tends to cause the erection of strong defenses and to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>Introduction 27</p>
<p class="calibre1">foster feelings of alienation between the shy person and his therapist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men tend to be bogged down with feelings of helplessness and hopelessness about their problem. And a moralistic (gung ho for rugged individualism) attitude together with unreasonable expectations regarding "homework exercises" only serves to render the attainment of therapeutic goals patently impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zimbardo's attitude towards therapy vis-a-vis shy clients is by his own admission one of <i class="calibre4"> "take it or leave it" </i>— <i class="calibre4">"do the homework exercises I'm</i> <i class="calibre4">requiring or don't come back". </i> His attitude is "if the therapeutic approach does not work, there must be something wrong with the SHY CLIENT, <i class="calibre4">not</i> with the therapeutic approach itself".</p>
<p class="calibre1">This book takes the exact opposite position. In short, I do not believe that <i class="calibre4"> square pegs can be forced into round holes</i> without causing an exacerbation of the problem. This book is aimed at effectively remedying severe loveshyness for <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of its victims. And it is dedicated to the proper engineering of therapeutic modalities that <i class="calibre4"> fit the client. </i> Therapeutic and preventive approaches must be made to fit the client in lieu of the traditional approach (which almost always fails) of trying to make the client fit some therapeutic approach that had been worked out in some moralistic ivory tower somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LoveShyness Costs Society Money</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the key reasons why the public needs to become concerned about loveshyness is that the problem does cost state and federal governments a great deal of money. During the past twenty years a great deal of research has been conducted on the relationship between <i class="calibre4"> social</i> <i class="calibre4">support systems</i> and medical well-being. In general, social support has to do with the extent to which a person is integrated into family and friendship networks. The results of this research have been quite consistent and remarkable. A list of some of the most representative findings follows: 1. Hospital patients who are married and who have friends who sincerely care about them recuperate from their diseases, surgical procedures, etc., significantly faster, and with fewer complications, than do those who are not married and/or do not have meaningful friendships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. People who have many disruptive changes happening in their lives tend to be far more vulnerable to all manner of medical and psychiatric disorders than those whose lives are not afflicted by disruptive changes.  <i class="calibre4"> However, </i> even among people with an enormous amount of disruptive change in their lives, medical and psychiatric symptoms are exceedingly rare among those</p>

<p class="calibre1">10. Low social/emotional support is strongly associated with all manner of serious crime and psychopathology. In fact, the more serious and violent a person's crime is, the more thoroughgoing the extent of alienation from supportive friendship and family networks that one can expect to find in the life of the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="calibre1">11. Social support increases coping ability, which is the etiological gateway to health and well-being. Social-emotional support short-circuits the illness responses to stress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">12. A low sense of social-emotional support exacerbates life stress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And for most people it is a major stressor <i class="calibre4"> in and of itself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen years ago sociologist Derek Phillips found that social participation was the single, most important correlate of human happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Working with a much larger, nationwide sample, psychologist Jonathan Freedman published essentially the same finding in 1978. During the 1970s decade many different sociologists and psychologists explored the causes of human happiness. And virtually all of these researchers concured with the conclusion of Phillips and Freedman that frequent social involvement with other people is the most important of all factors giving rise to feelings of happiness and well-being. The second most important factor, by the way, is the feeling that one is in charge—in the "driver's seat"—of one's own life. And this too is a feeling which tends to be virtually nonexistent among the ranks of the severely loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scores of additional research findings similar to the foregoing could be cited. The message of all of this work is clear: love relationships and friendship support systems help people to cope better with the stresses and strains of everyday living. The very fact of having an intimate confidante mollifies and greatly reduces the effects of stress upon both the mind and the body. Hence, medical and psychiatric symptomology tends to be significantly less for people who are well integrated into family and peer group support systems. Further, when illness does strike, those with love relationships and friends manage to recuperate significantly faster than those lacking in such social-emotional support systems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, people with families and close friends make significantly fewer demands upon medical care delivery systems than do those without close ties to family or to friends. The same can be said in regard to psychiatric services. The lonely and the isolated constitute the major consumers of psychiatric services; and this includes services which are geared towards the remediation of alcohol and drug addiction. Indeed, this fact is well symbolized in the title of a psychiatric book that was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>30 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular approximately ten years ago. Its title was PSYCHOTHERAPY: THE PURCHASE OF FRIENDSHIP.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, most people know how to make friends and to give each other the needed social and emotional support. Similarly, most people are able to marry and to partake in the full range of normal social activities pertinent to family formation. People such as the loveshy who lack these abilities need to be systematically educated and trained so that they too can be effectively shielded against many of the stresses and strains of everyday living. It is obviously in society's best interest to provide such education and training. Any expenditures that are made in the interests of such training will eventually be repaid to society more than one-hundredfold in the form of healthier, better adjusted citizens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, if every person has both a lover and a confidante, the incidence of medical and psychiatric pathologies will be far less than what prevails today. The savings in both money and in human suffering will be extremely formidable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Summary</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is strong empirical evidence that love relationships <i class="calibre4"> when they</i> <i class="calibre4">are reciprocal</i> tend to promote psychoemotional growth as well as social, financial, and career effectiveness. Many studies also support the view that it is the most interpersonally skilled people who are most likely to enjoy mutual, reciprocated love relationships early in life. Moreover, young men who are involved in such heterosexual love relationships have been found to be far more likely than those not so involved to be enmeshed in networks of rewarding <i class="calibre4"> male</i> friendships. Young men who throughout their high school and college years continue to experience trouble meeting members of the opposite sex almost invariably tend to be characterized by a dearth of male friendships as well. And their social ineffectiveness here can normally be counted upon to greatly undermine their ultimate life chances for success and happiness in the world of work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men are usually highly self-conscious; and this impedes their performance academically, socially, and in the world of employment. In lacking normal degrees of assertiveness, the loveshy are often passed over and ignored by those who could provide significant rewards.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in lacking normal levels of sociability and social self-confidence they make other people around them feel uncomfortable, insecure, and in time somewhat hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most important reasons why loveshyness is a serious problem is that it prevents its victims from participating in self-confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>Introduction 31</p>
<p class="calibre1">building experiences. There are very few if any experiences that build the sense of self-confidence and self-esteem of a young man more surely and thoroughly than that of winning the companionship and emotional support of an attractive girl. Furthermore, the self-confidence that eminates from successful heterosexual interaction is scarcely ever limited to that sphere of human activity alone. It <i class="calibre4"> transfers</i> to virtually all spheres of human activity in which a person happens to be involved.2</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Plan of the Book</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book represents the first scientific study ever published on the subject of loveshyness. The book has five essential purposes: (1) to create a compassionate awareness and understanding of a long neglected and ignored segment of the American male population; (2) to help the public better understand and constructively deal with the loveshy; (3) to help the loveshy better understand themselves and to clearly see that they are not alone—and that they need to unite as a social and political force on behalf of their own interests; (4) to delineate as fully and comprehensively as possible <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the causal antecedents of loveshyness; and (5) to delineate and explain the most promising modalities for both the treatment and the prevention of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The remaining chapters of this book are organized into <i class="calibre4"> three sections. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The chapters in the first section <i class="calibre4"> (Part One)</i> are concerned with the biological underpinnings of severe shyness. This book endeavors to be quite thoroughgoing in its approach to the subject of inborn factors. There are more myths and falsehoods floating about pertinent to the relationship between biology and shyness than there are about any other shyness-related issue. These myths must be arrested and corrected if the loveshy are ever to be properly understood and successfully helped. In the absence of a valid understanding of the biological basis of shyness, there is no way severe and chronic loveshyness can ever be prevented or successfully treated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chapters contained in <i class="calibre4"> Part Two</i> of this book are based upon an original investigation of 300 loveshy men, 200 of whom were between the ages of 19 and 24 when the data were obtained, and 100 of whom were between the ages of 35 and 50. This study also incorporated a comparison group of 200 <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> men, all of whom were between the ages of 19 and 24, when the data were obtained from them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chapters contained under <i class="calibre4"> Part Two</i> systematically compare the loveshys with the non-shys on such important matters as (1) past family life with the mother and father, (2) family composition, (3) peer group life throughout the formative years of childhood and adolescence, (4) the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>32 INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">development of early boy-girl romantic interests, (5) current sex life and sexual attitudes/values, (6) current social and demographic characteristics, (7) current life styles, (8) employment effectiveness, (9) medical symptoms, (10) physical characteristics, (11) the need for physical beauty in a lover, (12) loneliness, (13) parenthood aspirations, (14) social-political attitudes and values, and (15) artistic and recreational interests and predilections.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The many comparisons that are made between the loveshy and non-shy men provide a host of very useful insights as to what the key factors are which cause and sustain pathological loveshyness. Each of the chapters in this section provides a unique constellation of insights which should ultimately prove very useful in both preventive and therapeutic work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The chapters contained in <i class="calibre4"> Part Three</i> deal with therapy and prevention. The chapter on "practice-dating therapy" introduces a therapeutic approach which will effectively cure 95 to 100 percent of even the most severe and intractable cases of loveshyness. This is perhaps the most important chapter in this book because it contains a detailed discussion of all the important aspects of a procedure which can ultimately emancipate the loveshy to the point where they are able to experience the love relationships to which they are eminently entitled. Hopefully this chapter will serve as an inspiration to all who work with the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prevention is similarly a very important subject. In a whole host of ways contemporary American society both creates and assures a certain amount of pathological loveshyness. The chapter on prevention provides a discussion of some thought-provoking, innovative ways of engineering our society so that painfully severe forms of shyness are effectively prevented from ever developing in the first place. Without inconveniencing the lives of the non-shy and without spending a great deal of money, there is a very great deal that can be done right now which could totally obviate the development of any new cases of severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, a summary chapter is provided which highlights the major points of the book as a whole. An overview is provided in this last chapter of some of the major recommendations towards which my research conclusions seem to point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, loveshyness is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> the mild little developmental problem that some people think it is. Loveshyness is a potentially very serious problem that is in society's best interests to prevent and to cure. It is my hope that this book will serve to effectively point the way toward that end.3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>Introduction 33</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Notes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. As incisive testimony to the inadequacy of Dr. Zimbardo's approach, Zimbardo's own <i class="calibre4"> "shyness clinic" </i> at Stanford University had to be disbanded because its therapeutic approach was simply not working. In fact, it was making many of its clients worse off than they had been when they had first sought aid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. As per WPIX (New York Channel 11) evening news (broadcast 11/23/84),  <i class="calibre4"> ten</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> of the letters which nationally syndicated advice columnist Ann Landers has received of late have been <i class="calibre4"> complaints about shyness. </i> According to Landers, the proportion of her letters containing complaints about shyness has increased noticeably over the past several years. The so-called "sexual revolution" has provided no relief for those afflicted with shyness-related problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Shyness among university males is by no means rare. In 1967, Ellis and Lane found that 25 percent of all university males surveyed were quite socially inactive due to shyness. They further found that 8 percent of all graduating seniors of heterosexual orientation had yet to experience their very first date with a girl. A study published in 1973 by Landis and Landis, further revealed that better than half of all college students experience at least occasional severe shyness symptoms vis-a-vis the opposite sex in informal social situations; and 25 percent of them were found to be victims of such severe shyness that they seldom or never dated. Only 23 percent of those surveyed were found to be always or nearly always comfortable in informal interaction with opposite sexed age mates.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">LoveShyness and the Nature</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Versus Nurture Debate</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In discussing their problems the loveshy often say that they feel as though they had been "born shy", or that shyness has always been a part of their fundamental underlying nature. And in taking this position about themselves and their problems the loveshy typically receive little compassion or understanding from the major power sources of contemporary psychology. Such major figures as Philip Zimbardo and Albert Ellis continue to insist that <i class="calibre4"> shyness is learned, </i> and that until shy people recognize and accept that alleged "fact" they will not be amenable to help.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A major purpose behind this book is to show that two quite crucial, dominating components of shyness <i class="calibre4"> are inborn. </i> Nevertheless, much of shyness behavior is a byproduct of a certain <i class="calibre4"> process</i> of learning—a process that is dependent upon inborn attributes and society's reactions to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key source of the confusion over this issue rests upon the fact that researchers in the behavioral and social sciences seldom if ever interact socially with the scholarly researchers of other disciplines. And as a result they often have little idea as to what is going on in fields other than their own. Research findings are constantly coming to the fore in such fields as human physiology, genetics, biochemistry, human anatomy, pharmocology, and microbiology, which have profound implications for the types of human problems with which clinical psychologists and sociologists deal. Yet with all their Ph.D.s and extensive learning in their own narrow areas of specialization, extremely few clinical psychologists or sociologists have any awareness at all of research findings of profound importance which have been arrived at by biologically and physiologically oriented research scholars. Even more tragically, they are often unaware of and refuse to consider the biologically oriented Work of their own colleagues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">37</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>38 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Academic people are often perceived by the public as constituting prime models of open-mindedness and of non-prejudiced attitudes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, a primary element of the philosophy of science has long been that any and all hypotheses are worth considering and researching until such time as those hypotheses have been disproved. Yet almost all clinical psychologists quite blythly reject the notion that there could possibly be anything "inborn" about shyness. And they are often quite callous and abrupt with colleagues who challenge "sacred" assumptions and long-standing theoretical ideology.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Genuine progress towards the prevention and cure of loveshyness can</i> <i class="calibre4">never be effected as long as scholars and researchers insist upon remaining rigidly</i> <i class="calibre4">married to their ideological and "therapeutic" belief systems. </i> Progress towards the prevention and cure of this and of countless other forms of human suffering can only (and will only) be made through the concerted efforts of research scholars from the <i class="calibre4"> full range</i> of disciplines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Phenomenon of Inborn Temperament</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the end of World War II, a small number of scientists in various parts of the world have been working on the issue of inborn components to personality. And a very great deal of progress has been made on this subject. Specifically,  <i class="calibre4"> temperament</i> can be defined as those elements of personality that are <i class="calibre4"> inborn, </i> whereas <i class="calibre4"> personality</i> can be defined as representing those comparatively stable elements of our behavior patterns that are learned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now, the five most important researchers on this subject have been (1) Hans J. Eysenck of the University of London, (2) Alexander Thomas of New York University, (3) Jerome Kagan of Harvard University, (4) Thomas J. Bouchard's University of Minnesota study on identical twins reared apart, and (5) David V. Sheehan's work on <i class="calibre4"> "anxiety disease". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This chapter will endeavor to present the prime essence of their findings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that their work holds indispensable significance for any truly valid and meaningful understanding of loveshyness. In the absence of an understanding of inborn temperament or of the genetic/biological basis of human personality differences, one cannot pretend to any reasoned understanding as to how loveshyness (or any other kind of shyness) develops. Without an accurate understanding as to how shyness develops, there can be no hope of effectively preventing the phenomenon from developing in the first place. And there can be no truly viable means of therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 39</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Puppies and Babies</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For many generations obstetrical nurses and midwives have known that all people are not born alike in terms of personality. A person can observe a large number of newborn babies, all of which are <i class="calibre4"> of the same</i> <i class="calibre4">gender. </i> And he or she will quickly notice that some of the infants cry a great deal more than others do. Some are exceedingly noisy whereas others tend to be remarkably quiet. Some infants wriggle around a very great deal and are quite restless. Others, on the other hand, tend to remain near motionless over long periods of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These and myriad other differences in behavioral reactions cannot be attributed to differences in quality of mothering, cleanliness care, medical attention, feeding, or gender. Environmental and learning-related factors have been carefully controlled by many different researchers. Yet no matter how carefully the various extraneous factors are controlled, male babies of the same very young age behave very differently from one another. And indeed the same applies to female babies of the same very young age. The important point is that these quite substantial differences in behavioral reactions have been observed in healthy, well-loved and cared for infants <i class="calibre4"> long before</i> any differential learning could possibly have taken place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologists, despite the widespread unwillingness among them to recognize the phenomena of inborn temperament in humans, often raise strains of white rats and mice for high aggression or low aggression, friendliness or seclusiveness, high versus low intelligence, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Psychologists' rat experiments often call for rats with a certain type of inborn temperament. Animals with the sort of native temperament appropos to experimental requirements are often bread; this can be accomplished rather easily in view of the comparatively short lifespan that characterizes the rat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doubtless many readers of this book have a strong interest in dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And whereas there is a variety of differences in modal temperament among the 125 A.K.C. recognized canine breeds, a person can take any one of these breeds and find highly substantial differences in temperament among the puppies of a newly born litter. For example, take a litter ofnewly born golden retrievers. Right at the outset some of the dogs will behave more assertively than others. Some will behave more sociably and fearlessly than others. Generally speaking the more assertive animals will get more food. And so after a comparatively brief period of time they will appear larger and healthier than their same-sexed litter mates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most dog manuals recommend that dog purchasers deliberately select the largest, most highly assertive, sociable animal from within a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>40 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">litter. It is believed that such a puppy has a head start towards developing into a happy, healthy animal—an animal that will adapt well to life among humans. In psychological terms it can be said that the highly sociable member of the litter has a strongly positive <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> vis-a-vis the educated humans who are trying to make a decision as to which member to purchase of the seven or eight member litter. This concept of <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i> is of enormous importance from the standpoint of enabling us to correctly understand the development of chronic loveshyness in humans. And I shall return to this matter shortly.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Work of Hans J. Eysenck</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior to the onset of World War II, Eysenck fled his native Germany.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He ended up in London where he successfully completed <i class="calibre4"> both</i> a Ph.D.</p>
<p class="calibre1">in psychology and an M.D. (doctor of medicine) degree as well. In short, Eysenck became one of the truly rare psychologists to develop a firm grounding in the biochemical and physiological nature of man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after the war was over, Eysenck commenced an extensive research investigation, parts of which he is still pursuing even today.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Much of his work entailed the recording of chemical and physiological attributes in humans. He has followed up thousands of people over twenty and even thirty years in some cases. And he has found that these physiological and biochemical indicators <i class="calibre4"> change very little</i> in the same person over the years and even over decades of time. More importantly, several of these biochemical and physiological indicators have a strong bearing upon the native,  <i class="calibre4"> inborn</i> differences in personality which we now call <i class="calibre4"> temperament. </i> These are the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> inborn behavioral differences which (1) cause some very young dogs to behave more assertively and sociably than others in their litter, and (2) which cause the temperamental differences in newborn human babies that have been observed by nurses and obstetricians down through the ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After some 35 years of research in both human physiology and in psychology, Eysenck has been able to conclude that there are but <i class="calibre4"> three</i> statistically independent, genetically rooted dimensions of inborn temperament: (1) extroversion-introversion or <i class="calibre4"> inhibition; </i> (2) <i class="calibre4"> emotionality</i> or</p>
<p class="calibre1">"high versus low anxiety threshold"; and (3) psychoticism. Curiously, the first two dimensions had been isolated by the ancient Greeks more than 2,500 years ago. Inasmuch as psychoticism is not related to the subject of loveshyness it will not be dealt with in this book.  <i class="calibre4"> Figure 1</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">graphically illustrates what has come to be known as the <i class="calibre4"> Eysenck Cross</i> <i class="calibre4">of Inborn Temperament. </i> And it is no accident that people who suffer from</p>

<p class="calibre1">Eysenck Cross of Inborn Temperament</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>42 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">chronic, intractable cases of loveshyness <i class="calibre4"> ALL</i> (with no exceptions) possess native temperaments which place them high up in the <i class="calibre4"> first quadrant</i> <i class="calibre4">(melancholic quadrant)</i> of the cross.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eysenck has concluded that inborn introversion is a natural byproduct of high native arousal levels in the cerebral cortex, and that these high arousal levels are caused by an overactive ascending reticular formation <i class="calibre4"> (lower brain)</i> which bombards the higher brain and central nervous system when social or other stimuli (perceived as threatening) are presented. This inborn hyperarousability of introverts accounts (1) for their forming conditioned patterns of anxiety and other inappropriate emotional responses all too easily; and (2) for the much greater difficulty in extinguishing maladaptive conditioned responses in introverts as compared to extroverts and ambiverts.  <i class="calibre4"> (Ambiverts</i> include the large majority of the population who are "in between" the extrovert and introvert extremes.) These facts partially account for the high prevalence of introverts among the ranks of neurotics and the loveshy. However, as I shall attempt to demonstrate shortly,  <i class="calibre4"> even an extreme introvert need not</i> <i class="calibre4">develop chronic, intractable loveshyness or any other form of neurosis. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast to the foregoing, Eysenck found that highly extroverted people tend to have <i class="calibre4"> underaroused</i> brains and nervous systems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, they are stimulus hungry. This is why they are always craving and seeking excitement of one kind or another, and why they must constantly have people around them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emotionality (high versus low anxiety threshold) is also a byproduct of inborn differences in human physiology, and particularly in the autonomic nervous system and lymbic system. Simply put, various reactions of the body such as heartbeat, rapid breathing, the cessation of digestion to make blood flow away from the stomach and to prepare the organism for flight or fight, tend to be significantly more labile and easily aroused <i class="calibre4"> (and less easily stopped)</i> in highly emotional <i class="calibre4"> (low</i> anxiety threshold) people. Emotional reactions are regulated by the visceral brain, and herein lies the locus of the inborn personality dimension of emotionality.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Studies employing the electroencephalograph have similarly revealed large differences between introverts and extroverts that are apparent from early infancy and which persist on a consistent basis throughout life. Introverts, for example, tend to have low amplitude and high frequency alpha waves, typical of high arousal, whereas extroverts tend to have high amplitude and low frequency alpha waves; and this is indicative of <i class="calibre4"> low</i> arousal. Of course, most people are ambiverts; and that means that most of us have patterns which fall somewhere <i class="calibre4"> in</i> <i class="calibre4">between</i> these two extremes. Many laboratory studies of conditioning, sensory thresholds, vigilence, reactions to emotion-producing stimuli,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 43</p>
<p class="calibre1">etc., have further revealed often dramatic differences between people high on the emotionality dimension and those low on it. And longitudinal studies have revealed that these inborn patterns tend to remain quite stable over many years and decades of time.</p>

<p class="calibre1">A person with a <i class="calibre4"> low</i> anxiety threshold experiences anxiety (1) much more frequently, and (2) much more intensely and <i class="calibre4"> painfully</i> than a person who is blessed with a <i class="calibre4"> high</i> or <i class="calibre4"> normal</i> anxiety threshold. Further (3), he is likely to begin experiencing the painful anxiety <i class="calibre4"> more quickly</i> upon the</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>44 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">initial presentation of whatever stimulus he had learned to associate with anxiety. People with <i class="calibre4"> high</i> native anxiety thresholds are often said to be "thick skinned" inasmuch as it usually requires a great deal to unruffle them. Corollatively, the person with a very <i class="calibre4"> low</i> native anxiety threshold is often said to be "thin skinned". Unlike the "thick skinned"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and "normal" persons, it takes very little to unruffle the "thin skinned"</p>
<p class="calibre1">person. To reiterate, he experiences anxiety more frequently, more painfully, more intensely, and in response to a wider range of different stimuli, than does the person with a normally high native anxiety threshold.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Before</i> a person can ever become loveshy he must first learn to associate the thought of informal, unstructured heterosexual interaction with the experience of strong and painful anxiety feelings. The low anxiety threshold (high inborn emotionality) must be there <i class="calibre4"> before</i> this can be accomplished to any "pathological" extent. People with middle-range to high anxiety thresholds occasionally do experience brief periods of loveshyness in their lives. In fact, transitory loveshyness is a quite commonplace accompaniment of adolescence here in American society—</p>
<p class="calibre1">although not in all societies. However, these transitory periods are <i class="calibre4"> exactly</i> <i class="calibre4">that. </i> In essence, for most teenagers they are transitory and brief. They last perhaps two or three weeks at the most. And then the person gets over the loveshyness to the point wherein he or she can interact reasonably comfortably vis-a-vis the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, even during periods when temporary, short-term loveshyness is suffered, moderate-to-high anxiety threshold teenagers typically continue interacting successfully with their same-sexed buddies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their low anxiety threshold peers, in stark contrast, usually interact <i class="calibre4"> (if</i> <i class="calibre4">they are males)</i> little if at all with their same-sexed peers. In short, by the mid-teens the very low anxiety threshold male has usually developed a generalized <i class="calibre4"> people-phobia. </i> He withdraws from same-sexed age mates just as he withdraws from opposite sexed age mates. And in not having the benefit of membership in a social network of same-sexed peers, no one feels any need to introduce him to potential girl friends. It is well known that in America most people of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> sexes meet their future spouses through social networks comprised of same-sexed peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the really crucial point which must be understood by the reader before we move onward is that a person can learn to associate <i class="calibre4">ANY</i> STIMULUS with strong, painful feelings of anxiety. In this book we are concerned with loveshyness. But a person can become extremely fearful of (and avoid) dogs or snakes or high elevations or automobiles or dentists or <i class="calibre4"> ANY</i> type of social experience <i class="calibre4"> OR</i> any substance which you, the reader, might wish to name. The inborn anxiety threshold does not determine (AND <i class="calibre4"> CANNOT</i> DETERMINE) specifically <i class="calibre4"> what</i> will arouse</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 45</p>
<p class="calibre1">the anxiety feelings and cause avoidance behavior. THIS MUST ALWAYS</p>
<p class="calibre1">BE LEARNED.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of loveshyness the victim <i class="calibre4"> learns</i> over time to associate the thought of interacting with an attractive woman with feelings of extremely painful anxiety. The loveshyness itself is <i class="calibre4"> learned; </i> the anxiety threshold, on the other hand, is <i class="calibre4"> INBORN. </i> If the native anxiety threshold is very low, the person will condition maladaptive anxiety patterns altogether too rapidly and easily. If the inborn anxiety threshold is <i class="calibre4"> high</i> or <i class="calibre4">moderate, </i> the person will not easily condition chronic anxiety patterns.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And through the help of his family and friendship networks he will be able to get over any shyness patterns which temporarily do develop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the essence of what I meant when in the second paragraph of the first page of this chapter I stated that two very major <i class="calibre4"> components</i> of shyness <i class="calibre4"> are inborn, </i> but that <i class="calibre4"> shyness itself is learned. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, there are <i class="calibre4"> two inborn components:</i> one is the high emotionality (low anxiety threshold); the second component is inhibition/introversion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When a person is <i class="calibre4"> very high</i> on <i class="calibre4"> both</i> emotionality <i class="calibre4"> and</i> introversion (the <i class="calibre4">MELANCHOLIC</i> quadrant of the Eysenck Cross of Inborn Temperament), the chances are exceedingly good within the context of American society that he will develop into a chronically loveshy individual. Let us now examine <i class="calibre4"> why</i> this is so, understanding at the outset that it is true for males but <i class="calibre4"> not</i> for females. (The reasons why it is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> true for females will be dealt with in due course.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Importance of Social Stimulus Value</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Social stimulus value</i> can be defined as simply representing the extent to which any given person or object is viewed as being attractive, desirable and worthwhile. Everything has a social stimulus value which will vary somewhat from one social/cultural context to another. In this book we are concerned with people rather than with objects. Every person has a social stimulus value right from the moment he or she is born.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This social stimulus value is heavily determined by the values of a particular society and culture. A person with a positive social stimulus value in Culture <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> may have a negative social stimulus value in Culture</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"B". </i> And most importantly, a specific behavioral manifestation that has neutral-to-positive social stimulus value when it is displayed by <i class="calibre4"> females</i> in a particular culture may wield a strongly negative or adverse social stimulus value when it is displayed by <i class="calibre4"> males</i> in that same culture.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, being frightened away by "rough and tumble"</p>
<p class="calibre1">play is a behavior that carries little or no adverse social stimulus value when it is displayed by little girls. But that <i class="calibre4"> same frightened behavior</i> tends</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>46 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">to carry very negative social stimulus value when it is displayed by little boys. And as a result, little boys are often punished for behavior patterns which yield rewards (or at least an absence of punishment) for little girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are <i class="calibre4"> four</i> personal characteristics entailing social stimulus value which are of preeminent importance: (1) native temperament; (2) physical attractiveness; (3) native aptitudes and intelligence; and (4) inborn health characteristics/limitations. And of these four, there is no doubt in my mind that native temperament is the most important, with level of physical attractiveness following closely behind in second place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The overall social stimulus value exuded by a person (small child) is determined primarily by five key factors:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The <i class="calibre4"> gender</i> of the child who is being evaluated; 2. The internalized values and normative expectations, feelings, etc., of the father, mother, and other significant family members; 3. The normative values, expectations, and feelings of the same-sexed peer group;</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Norms and values of school officials and policy makers; 5. Norms and values of the community and nation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A child's developing self-image and the likelihood of his developing a case of pathological shyness will be a direct function of the <i class="calibre4"> goodness of</i> <i class="calibre4">fit</i> of these five factors with his (1) native temperament, (2) physical appearance, (3) aptitudes &amp; intelligence, and (4) health.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me illustrate with some insights derived from findings reported in various parts of this book. In American society there is an irrational albeit near ubiquitous <i class="calibre4"> learned</i> tendency on the part of most young adults to associate the very thought of "boy" with the thought of a natural, inborn enthusiasm for baseball, football, and basketball. Thus my findings clearly show that those boys who best fit this stereotyped expectation quickly come to possess the strongest interpersonal skills and the lowest incidence of loveshyness. On the other hand, my data also show that those boys who fit this stereotype least well include among their members the highest incidence of intractable loveshyness combined with a history of inadequate socialization for interpersonal skills and social self-confidence. Girls without a natural enthusiasm for such rough, contact sports do not suffer negative outcomes as a result. A liking for such sports is considered (at best) <i class="calibre4"> optional</i> for them, and it is not normatively prescribed as it is for boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is through the cumulative tenor of the responses of others,  <i class="calibre4"> particularly parents and peers, </i> that a child decides whether it is intelligent or stupid, attractive or homely, lovable or unlovable, competent or incompetent, worthy of social companionship or worthless in this regard. If a male child is born in America with an innate temperament that places</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 47</p>
<p class="calibre1">him high up in the <i class="calibre4"> melancholic quadrant</i> (quadrant #1) of the Eysenck Cross, and if this native temperament with its concomitants of very low pain and anxiety thresholds, nervousness and inhibition/introversion, cause him to constantly avoid the rough and tumble play of the all-male peer group (and not physically defend himself against its assaults), that child is highly likely to develop a very low social self-image along with a case of intractable shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a development is <i class="calibre4"> NEVER</i> a <i class="calibre4"> necessary</i> consequence of such an inborn temperament. There is nothing intrinsically "unhealthy" about being an emotional introvert <i class="calibre4"> per se. </i> But insofar as <i class="calibre4"> within the American</i> <i class="calibre4">social context</i> such a temperament is likely to serve as a stimulus for consistent and continual bullying, ignoring and rejection on the part of the peer group and expressed disappointment and disapproval on the part of parents (especially fathers), shyness together with a low self-esteem, a "people-phobia", and poor interpersonal skills are all highly likely to develop.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Work of Alexander Thomas</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The extensive research on inborn temperament by Alexander Thomas and his associates at New York University is of especial relevance to a complete understanding of how severe loveshyness develops. Like Hans Eysenck. Dr. Thomas has been able to show that the traits of inborn temperament (such as introversion-extroversion, activity level, emotionality-withdrawal, etc.) persist from very early childhood over long periods of time. However, he has also been able to demonstrate how <i class="calibre4"> NO</i> attribute of native temperament can ever <i class="calibre4"> by itself</i> be indicative of "sickness" or of "neurosis". After having followed up some 146 children for sixteen years after their respective births, he found that whether or not a child developed neurotic behavior patterns as a result of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">"undesirable" trait of native temperament was <i class="calibre4"> entirely determined</i> by the way in which that child had been treated by parents and peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas was especially interested in the etiology of behavior disorders in children. And his research data clearly proved that behavior disorders are the result of a <i class="calibre4"> poorness of fit</i> between (1) a child's native temperament on the one hand, and (2) internalized norms, values and expectations of parents, peers and teachers, on the other hand. To the extent that a child enjoys <i class="calibre4"> a reasonably good fit</i> between these two factors, to that extent chronic behavior disorders (such as shyness and neuroses) will never develop in that child. The poorer the fit, on the other hand, the greater the likelihood that a child will develop problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>48 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">In his book entitled TEMPERAMENT AND BEHAVIOR DISORDERS IN CHILDREN, Dr. Thomas talks at considerable length about what he calls the <i class="calibre4"> "slow-to-warm-up child". </i> And he presents an impressive amount of research evidence showing how this type of seemingly "difficult" child can eventually become indistinguishable in adjustment from the other seemingly "easy", naturally sociable children when (1) copious opportunity is accorded for informal play amidst an <i class="calibre4"> accepting</i> peer group that is engaged in enjoyable, non-anxiety-provoking activities, and (2) when patient, kindly and accepting attitudes are held by parents and teachers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, when a child is <i class="calibre4"> accepted as he is</i> he becomes free to grow, to mature, to change in a positive direction, and to become his true self. When a child is accorded caring and respect for his feelings and emotional needs, he inevitably becomes a caring and respecting person who gradually comes to "fit in" remarkably well. But when that same "slow-to-warm-up" child is forced to conform to parental or teacher expectations and to play amidst a physically aggressive, highly competitive peer group which he finds frightening and anxiety-provoking, he tends to withdraw. Indeed, he tends to regress and to become progressively less mature by comparison with the other children in his age cohort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the more rigid and uncompromising the parental expectations are, the more time the "slow-to-warm-up" child will take to adjust, to mature, and to "fit in". Simply put, it is counterproductive to try to standardize human personality because the raw materials (including native temperament) differ for each child within each of the two sexes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Thomas has argued, there is a long-standing tradition in American society of trying to force square pegs into round holes—of endeavoring to do whatever seems feasible to make the behavior, feelings and interests of a child <i class="calibre4"> fit</i> prevailing norms and expectations. Thomas' findings show that there is a costly price to be paid for our callous insistence upon trying to standardize human personalities. A far more socially beneficial approach, as Thomas' research data have shown, is to modify the expectations of parents, peers and teachers to fit the native temperament of the child. When <i class="calibre4"> this tact</i> is followed, the child flourishes, grows, matures, and is ultimately as normal in his behavior patterns as the bulk of his peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Modifying parental and peer expectations can be effectively accomplished through (1) education of the parents and teachers as to the nature and limits posed by native temperament; (2) the creation of <i class="calibre4"> support groups</i> for parents of shy, inhibited, "slow-to-warm-up" children; and (3) providing the seemingly "difficult" child with a <i class="calibre4"> choice</i> of peer groups</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 49</p>
<p class="calibre1">and of peer group activities. In regard to this last point, one child's medicine is another child's poison. The <i class="calibre4"> typical</i> male child flourishes in the all-boy peer group that is engaged in "rough and tumble" play. In contrast, the introverted, inhibited, "slow-to-warm-up" child flourishes best in the small sized,  <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> peer group that engages in more gently competitive activities such as volleyball, bowling, hide and seek, miniature golf, swimming, shuffle board, horseshoes, croquet, ping pong, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, militant physical education enthusiasts have quibbled that these more gentle sports and games do not provide the exercise that male children need. (This objection is ludicrous inasmuch as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gentle" sport of swimming, for example, exercises more bodily muscles than does football, basketball and baseball. Moreover, all male children <i class="calibre4">are not alike</i> in their exercise needs!) As Thomas' research data have shown, the traditional tact of insisting that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> male children take part in the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> "rough and tumble" activity has eventuated in two consequences that are very deleterious from the standpoint of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> the individual <i class="calibre4"> and</i> the wider society:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) The melancholic child (1st quadrant, page 41) <i class="calibre4"> withdraws</i> from play and consequently does not get any outdoor physical exercise <i class="calibre4"> at all. </i> In short, very few melancholic male children sub-ordinate themselves to the rigid requirement they they <i class="calibre4"> must</i> play "rough and tumble" games. They simply withdraw; and as a result they get little or nothing of the physical exercise which the physical education enthusiasts deem so extremely important. The point here is that <i class="calibre4"> something is always better than</i> <i class="calibre4">nothing! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) The melancholic child fails to develop the interpersonal skills and the social self-confidence that are so necessary for success, happiness and adjustment in this or in any other society. Since he is mistreated, bullied, abused, and/or ignored by the peers society tells him he <i class="calibre4"> must</i> play with, he quickly develops a "people-phobia". In essence, he learns to associate being around age-mates with feelings of anxiety, pain, and strong displeasure. More succinctly, whereas most people learn to associate feelings of pleasure and happiness with the idea of "friends", the melancholic boy learns to associate feelings of pain and anxiety with the idea of "friends". For him peers cause <i class="calibre4"> pain,</i> NOT pleasure!</p>
<p class="calibre1">This latter point is of enormous importance. Active involvement in enjoyable childhood play has long been known to be an indispensable Prerequisite (in both humans and monkeys) to competent, effective</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>50 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">adulthood. Indeed, social and psychoemotional adjustment in adulthood <i class="calibre4"> absolutely requires and necessitates</i> a long-term history of happy involvement in play throughout the years of childhood. Play is not the sort of frivilous activity some people think it is. Play represents an indispensable component of the classroom of life—much more indispensable, in fact, than the "3 Rs" that are learned in the indoor classroom. Research has shown that people can pick up the "3 Rs" and other intellectual/</p>
<p class="calibre1">technical skills <i class="calibre4"> at any age. </i> Unfortunately, socioemotional and interpersonal skills that are not picked up at the normal times during the course of childhood play cannot normally be picked up for the first time in later life. More succinctly, it is vastly more difficult for an adult to pick up interpersonal skills and social self-confidence <i class="calibre4"> for the first time, </i> than it is for him to pick up intellectual/technical skills or knowledge for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People can cultivate and expand their intellects at any age. Unfortunately, the nature of man is such that deficits in the interpersonal/</p>
<p class="calibre1">socioemotional areas cannot easily be rectified in adulthood or late adolescence. This is why education in these areas is so important throughout the years of early and middle childhood. And it is the peer group,  <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">parents or teachers, who provide this indispensable education. And this is why we shall never successfully prevent chronic loveshyness in males unless and until we make sure that <i class="calibre4"> ALL</i> little boys have ready access at all times throughout their formative years to a peer group and to play activities which they can truly enjoy and to which they can always look forward with positive emotional feelings of happiness and enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Jerome Kagan Work</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jerome Kagan is an eminent Harvard University psychologist. And his represents the third of the five major research efforts leading towards an understanding and appreciation of the innate biological underpinnings of human personality and behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the early 1960s Dr. Kagan carefully examined nearly two dozen classes of behavior in a large group of children composed of hundreds of two and three-year-olds. These classes of behavior included such traits as dependency, aggression, dominance, competitiveness, passivity, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> These children were all followed up over a substantial number of years. And only one of these traits turned out to have a substantial bearing upon later behavior. And that trait was <i class="calibre4"> inhibition. </i> In his initial work Dr. Kagan called this trait "passivity". Now he simply designates it as "inhibition".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 51</p>
<p class="calibre1">The difference between inhibited and uninhibited infants is best seen when an unfamiliar event occurs. Inhibited youngsters stop whatever they are doing, as though they were trying to understand the puzzling event. The uninhibited children seem to note the event, but then go on to other matters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a Fels Institute study there were seven boys who were noteworthy for being extremely inhibited and easily frightened during their first three years—the period during which they were observed and studied. These children were all healthy and came from good families. The key point is that they behaved in a consistently <i class="calibre4"> inhibited</i> way. Dr. Kagan followed up these boys until they became adults. And he found their temperaments in adulthood to be conspicuously different from those of other adults in his study. All were heterosexual, but all were still very inhibited and "shy" in their informal interactions with others—particularly in the sort of ambiguous social situations wherein there is no role to play or script to follow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As adults all seven of these men were found to be particularly vulnerable to anxiety attacks and to various sorts of internal conflicts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interesting too is the fact that none of them had pursued any sports or athletic activities, and none had pursued traditional masculine occupations. For example, two of the men had become music teachers and one had become a psychologist. None had entered the world of engineering or business. (All of these men would doubtless fall in the "melancholic"  <i class="calibre4"> first quadrant</i> of the Eysenck Cross. See <i class="calibre4"> Figure One</i> on page 41.) Dr. Kagan has found evidence that what most people describe as fearfulness may be accompanied by such positive intellectual qualities as curiosity and creativity, which can have a major impact on later mental development and career choice. As I shall document in this book, loveshy men do indeed appear to be more intellectually oriented than the majority of the population. And, in general, they do seem to acquire rather extensive educations despite their social/emotional difficulties. On the other hand, the low emotional resilence ("thin skinned") and low competitiveness which characterizes loveshy men causes the majority of them to fail to use their educations propitiously. Being too shy to compete for the best jobs, they are commonly shunted to positions which are sharply below their levels of attained education.  <i class="calibre4"> Education alone does</i> <i class="calibre4">not confer social self-confidence]</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of Christopher Jencks' findings which I reported in Chapter 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">is also of relevance here. Nondaters had devoted a great deal more of their time to studying during their high school years than did those who had been actively involved in dating and partying. And more of the nondaters managed to go on to college and to actually get through college. But by age 28, those who had dated and partied in high school</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>52 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">were found to be earning significantly greater amounts of money than the nondaters. Again, the daters and party-goers (1) had gained interpersonal skills and social self-confidence crucial for effectiveness in the world of employment, and (2) the self-same competitive drive and emotional resilence necessary for involvement in dating (for males at least) appeared to have been quite useful for success in the cold, hard business world of jobs and careers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several studies in which Kagan had followed inhibited boys up through the school years towards adulthood clearly indicated that the ones who had been inhibited as three-year olds tended throughout their school years to: (1) avoid dangerous activities, (2) show exceedingly little physical or verbal aggression, (3) display substantial timidity in social situations, (4) tended to avoid sports and other masculine activities throughout their childhood and adolescence, and (5) tended to conform more than most children to their parents' wishes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Heart Rate Patterns</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most puzzling of Dr. Kagan's findings was that as adults the heart-rate patterns of the inhibited boys showed an absence of sinus arrhythmia. Sinus arrhythmia refers to the fact that normally the heart rate increases when a person takes a breath, and it decreases when he/</p>
<p class="calibre1">she exhales. But in an experimental session when males high on <i class="calibre4"> inhibition</i> ("melancholia") listened to tape recorded discussions involving a very high aggression and/or sexuality content, much of their sinus arrhythmia, or variability in heart rate, disappeared. In essence, their heart rates became <i class="calibre4"> stable</i> during these periods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1970 Dr. Kagan and a team of researchers were conducting a study on the effects of day care on Chinese and Caucasian children residing in the Boston area. The Chinese-American infants showed more stable heart rates and were more inhibited in unfamiliar social situations than the Caucasian children. This pattern of differences tended to hold up irrespective of whether the children studied were in attendance at day care facilities or had been reared strictly at home. And in a study of three-year olds which was recently published in a book entitled THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">SECOND YEAR, Dr. Kagan found that <i class="calibre4"> shy</i> children showed the same heart anomaly whenever they were confronted with the unfamiliar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Kagan and his staff placed the inhibited children with an unfamiliar adult or child or took them to an unfamiliar day care center, they were initially very anxiety-ridden and behaved in an exceedingly reserved and inhibited fashion. To use Alexander Thomas' terminology, they were exceedingly "slow to warm up". When the mothers of these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 53</p>
<p class="calibre1">children left them alone in a room, they became much more distressed than the other children in the study.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related study of Chinese and Caucasian newborns, Daniel Freedman similarly found that the Chinese infants had a higher <i class="calibre4"> inhibition</i> <i class="calibre4">mean</i> (average) than did the Caucasian infants. For example, in one of his tests when he covered the baby's nose, a Caucasian baby would <i class="calibre4">typically</i> squirm and flail about more than would a <i class="calibre4"> typical</i> Chinese baby.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking his cue from this research effort by Freedman, Dr. Kagan decided to look at another sample composed exclusively of Caucasian children, and see whether there was any connection between the tendency towards behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar during the first and second years of life, and a <i class="calibre4"> stable heart rate</i> while studying discrepant information. In brief, he again found that this expected relationship <i class="calibre4"> did obtain. </i> And he realized at this time that he had a replication which strongly suggested that he was looking at a reliable phenomenon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This relationship between heart rate and behavioral inhibition makes theoretical sense. And Dr. Kagan began to suspect that this relationship constitutes a key portion of the physiological underpinnings of the inborn temperamental trait of behavioral inhibition (shyness). There are several mechanisms which could lead to a loss of variability in heart rate. And one of the more reasonable of these involves the balance between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems. When a person inspires, the discharge of the sympathetic system leads to an increase in heart rate. And when a person breathes out, the action of the parasympathetic nervous system, through the vagus nerve, leads to a decrease in the heart rate. It is important to realize, of course, that it is the sympathetic nervous system that causes the heart to pound when we are afraid. And it is the parasympathetic nervous system that slows the heart beat back down again.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a discharge from the sympathetic nervous system blocked the vagus nerve, the heart rate would not decrease with expiration. Indeed, it would stabilize or become less variable. Moreover, if this is a correct interpretation, then perhaps inhibited children and adults have a special tendency to become sympathetically aroused by psychologically unfamiliar or ambiguous stimuli. In essence, they are unusually apprehensive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To use Eysenck's terminology, perhaps the ambiguous and unfamiliar in a social situation arouses their low inborn anxiety threshold; and they withdraw—thus assuring that they will be perceived by most others as "slow to warm up". And since society (male peer group in particular) seems to want a certain number of deviants, it uses these</p>
<p class="calibre1">"slow to warm up", easily frightened, "shell-shock prone" tendencies as a major criterion for recruiting some children and adults for the deviant role in life. And these "slow to warm up", easily frightened tendencies</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>54 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">become publicly labeled, internalized by the victim, and reinforced (strengthened). Simply put, nurture (social learning) strengthens and enhances nature (inborn tendencies). And this applies to <i class="calibre4"> both</i> "good"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and "bad" inborn tendencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In late 1979, Dr. Kagan conducted another confirmatory study.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several hundred Caucasian children, all of whom were just under two years of age, were carefully screened; 117 of these children were put through a series of episodes that included unfamiliar people, a robot, and separation from the mother. Dr. Kagan and his associate for this study (Dr. Cynthia Garcia-Coll) then selected thirty consistently inhibited youngsters and thirty consistently uninhibited youngsters. And they recorded the heart rates and respirations of all of these children during a series of stimulus episodes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One month later Dr. Garcia-Coll retested all of these children. The inhibited children had higher and more stable heart rates when they were confronted with information that was difficult for them to assim-ilate. In essence, her findings continued to support Dr. Kagan's premise that there is a strong relationship between (a) inhibited behavior when a person is exposed to unfamiliar people or social contexts, and (b) heart-rate patterns in response to unfamiliar stimuli.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten months subsequent to this research effort Dr. Garcia-Coll visited forty of the children in their homes. And she also brought them into the laboratory for a special test. In the laboratory environment each child was confined with and asked to play with an unfamiliar child of the <i class="calibre4"> opposite</i> behavioral style. The inhibited children quickly became highly apprehensive in this situation. And all were <i class="calibre4"> dominated</i> by the uninhibited children.3 The inhibited ones retreated to their mothers and became very quiet. In addition, they continued to show a more stable heart rate in response to discrepant information than did the uninhibited children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Dr. Kagan's writings point out that a good many behavioral geneticists (such as Plomin and Rowe) have found that when one identical twin is extremely inhibited or uninhibited vis-a-vis strangers, the other identical twin tends to behave quite similarly. That concordance does not usually exist between fraternal twins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, recent studies at the University of Minnesota have shown that genetically identical twins are far more likely to share shyness than are fraternal twins. In fact, identical twins reared apart in totally different households are far more likely to be alike on shyness than are fraternal twins who grow up in the same household with the same parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Identical twins, of course, have the same genetic constitution, whereas fraternal twins (even when they are of the same gender) do not inasmuch as their bodies grew from different zygotes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 55</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Long-Separated Identical Twins</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In looking over the available literature on long-separated identical twins, it is quite clear that something very strange and uncanny is going on. Scores of cases are now on record regarding identical twins who had been separated shortly after birth and given to different pairs of adopting parents. In several of these instances the identical twins did not even know that they had an identical twin brother or sister until as an adult they bumped into him or her quite by accident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though many of these twins never see their twin for as much as thirty or more years after birth and grow up virtually hundreds of miles apart, when they do <i class="calibre4"> first meet</i> they often find that (1) they have married women/men of the same first name, physical description, career and education; (2) they themselves have pursued the same education and career; (3) they drive the same make and model of motor vehicle; (4) they have the same breed of dog and use the same name for their dogs; (5) their children are of the same ages and genders and had been assigned the same first names; and (6) their personality traits, behavioral dispositions and predilections are all found to be exactly the same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A multidisciplinary organization of researchers at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, (headed by Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr.), is presently engaged in an exhaustive study of identical twins, with especial emphasis upon those who had been separated at birth and who had grown up without any contact of any sort with each other. The range of similarities among these pairs has been found to be absolutely astounding, and is in fact greater even than the range of similarities usually found for identical twins reared together in the same household.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously this material has a substantial bearing upon the loveshyness issue, and upon the whole matter of <i class="calibre4"> "elastic limits" </i> and of human destiny and purpose. This subject has a further bearing upon the limits of free choice and the extent to which some aspects of "choice" may be illusory, and <i class="calibre4"> may</i> be a function of karmic destiny and astrology. In essence, the available research data on identical twins provides one of the strongest sets of evidence supporting the position that loveshyness is rooted to a large extent in a very strong biological base.4</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, Dr. Kagan believes that socialization experiences in the family and with peers can cause children <i class="calibre4"> (particularly boys)</i> with inborn inhibition to become even more inhibited as well as extremely fearful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Alexander Thomas has pointed out, a "slow to warm up" little boy can and will develop a strong, positive self-image plus fine sociable tendencies <i class="calibre4"> if</i> he is accorded appropriate levels of emotional support and tolerance from parents and peers— <i class="calibre4">if</i> he is accepted, respected and liked for <i class="calibre4"> what</i> he is as he is.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>56 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately in contemporary American society this is highly unlikely to happen. Behavioral inhibition and reserve is viewed as highly undesirable in boys. Simply put, such behavior does not <i class="calibre4"> fit</i> traditional gender role expectations for boys. And even though the women's liberation movement has created a great deal of new role flexibility for little girls, such role flexibility has not as yet even begun to extend to little boys. In fact, the pressure on boys to participate in rough, contact sports is even greater today than it had been in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Hans Eysenck's data have shown, people with inborn inhibition tend to learn things far more deeply and thoroughly than uninhibited people do. And they corollatively find it far more difficult than uninhibited people to forget things. Thus malevolent experiences in the all-male peer group and/or in the home will have a much more deleterious impact upon those with inborn inhibition than upon those with more propitious inborn characteristics. In this sense <i class="calibre4"> nurture</i> (experience/social learning) tends to interact in a synergistic way with nature (inborn temperament). And as a result of disparaging labeling and other forms of punishment or reward, social experience tends to reinforce and render increasingly intractable that which we call nature (inborn temperament).</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Importance of Enzymes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps even more intriguing from the standpoint of leading us toward an understanding of chronic loveshyness is the work of biochemistry professor Dr. Justa Smith, of Rosary Hill College, in Buffalo, New York. Dr. Smith believes that the <i class="calibre4"> first or initial cause</i> of severe and intractable loveshyness is a <i class="calibre4"> malfunctioning enzyme. </i> Enzymes are func-tionally indispensable to the normal growth and development of all living organisms. Without normally functioning enzymes the hormones cannot and will not do their job, even if they (the hormones) are present throughout the bloodstream in appropriate abundance. For example, elementary school aged boys and girls have about the same ratio of estrogens to androgens throughout their respective blood streams. The secondary sex characteristics are prevented from developing in children this young because the appropriate enzymes have not as yet been released. The pituitary gland along with possibly the pineal gland serve to govern the time clock that determines for each person when the appropriate enzymes will be released. Again, it is only when a healthy, appropriate and well-functioning enzyme is released into the blood that appropriate growth changes can occur. The hormones are necessary for the promotion of these growth changes. But hormones will not operate in the absence of the appropriate enzymes to metabolize them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 57</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Enzyme Activity and Propitious Fetal Growth</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Justa Smith together with an ever increasing number of other biochemists and microbiologists believe that a number of different enzymes crucial to the development of "culture-appropriate" masculine assertiveness, competitiveness and drive, are released sometime during the second trimester of pregnancy— <i class="calibre4">if the fetus is male. </i> These enzymes permit the testosterones and androgens to work on various sections of the brain which nature has programmed to be responsive to these male hormones. In other words, assuming healthy enzymes, the male hormones will work to masculinize the brain. If one or another enzyme is for any reason malfunctioning, then the part of the brain that is specific to that enzyme will not permit the male hormones to do their job. And that part of the boy fetus' brain will not be suitably or sufficiently masculinized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the brain of a fetus is left alone, it will develop into a <i class="calibre4"> female brain</i> regardless of whether or not it is exposed to feminizing hormones. In essence, this is one of the myriad reasons why the male is a more delicate organism than the female. Many more things can go wrong in male fetal development than in female fetal development. Unless the male fetus is exposed to masculinizing hormones <i class="calibre4"> plus</i> the enzymes which permit each of these hormones to work on various sections of the brain, that male fetus will develop a brain that is in at least some ways <i class="calibre4"> feminine. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of ways in which it will be feminine will be determined by the number of sections of the developing brain that had been deprived of the appropriate masculinizing enzymes. Again, the enzymes permit the male hormones to do their masculinizing job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, as I point out in a later chapter, maternal depression, stress, nervousness and irascibility of temperament, have been found to impact adversely upon the masculinizing enzymes and hormones. This is why tense, nervous, depressed, high strung women are far more likely than calm, happy-go-lucky, relaxed women to give birth to children who are passive, shy, and noncompetitive. Of course, if such a woman's fetus is female there is no chance that any harm will be done. But if the fetus is male, harm quite typically is done as a result of important enzymes being neutralized or enfeebled by the psychosomatic, biochemical processes caused by the pregnant woman's irascibility, depression, tense nervousness, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are different sections of the fetal brain that need to be masculinized. And each of these sections calls for the propitious operation of a <i class="calibre4"> different</i> enzyme. Some sections of the brain have to do with sexual/</p>
<p class="calibre1">romantic directionality. When these brain sections are inadequately masculinized, the person stands a good chance of becoming a pre-homosexual</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>58 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">or a pre-bisexual little boy. Other brain sections have to do with effeminacy. When these are not masculinized, the person becomes an effeminate little boy. And contrary to popular impression, most effeminate men are NOT homosexual. Because of a specific enzyme deficiency during their prenatal period, they become effeminate heterosexuals. And most of them, like heterosexuals generally, will marry and become fathers. But because of rigid and often uncompromising gender role expectations for males, they will suffer much teasing and hazing throughout their formative years as a result of their effeminacy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, another section of the brain has to do with social assertiveness, competitiveness and drive—the opposite of "feminine" passivity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is the brain section which has a very strong bearing upon shyness generally, and especially upon loveshyness and the behavioral inertia that typically accompanies it. The nonassertive, unaggressive little boy will commonly develop non-masculine interest patterns. In essence, he violates traditional gender role expectations in terms of interests and preferences rather than in terms of either effeminacy or in terms of homosexuality or erotic orientation. For example, he will prefer quiet, non-physical forms of play; working with arts and crafts, music and theatre arts, dolls and figurines, etc., all of which relate in different ways to violation of gender role expectation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, occasionally a number of different enzymes will malfunction while a child is intrautero. And in that case the child <i class="calibre4"> (if male)</i> will develop a number of different problems. For example, he may develop BOTH effeminacy AND homosexuality. Or he may develop BOTH</p>
<p class="calibre1">effeminacy and chronic shyness. Or he may develop chronic shyness and homosexuality. And in a few rare cases he may develop all three of these separate problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The shy, passive boy is very often mislabeled "homosexual" just as the effeminate boy is perhaps even more often mislabeled "homosexual". Conservative and rigid people tend to apply the label "homosexual" to any young boy who violates traditional gender role expectations, just as these same people commonly affix such labels as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"communist" and "unAmerican" to any person who espouses a political, social or religious attitude or belief with which they happen to disagree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just as the person who believes in the judicious propriety of premarital cohabitation is almost never either a "communist" or "anti-American" or even "promiscuous", so the little boy who prefers gentle, quiet activities in a coeducational play group is similarly very seldom a pre-homosexual. For such a little boy, the enzyme affecting heterosexual directionality worked <i class="calibre4"> properly. </i> Similarly, the one impacting upon masculinity of demeanor (versus effeminacy) probably also worked satisfactorily well. Only the enzyme affecting that part of the brain which is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a><img src="index-90_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 59</p>
<p class="calibre1">associated with masculine assertiveness and competitive drive failed to work well enough to permit the appropriate androgens and testosterones to do their brain-masculinizing work.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Painful Anxiety and Enzyme Neutralization</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as tensions, stress and anxiety feelings in a pregnant woman have been found to cripple and slow down enzyme activity in the fetus, severe stress and anxiety in a grown man or teenager will similarly cripple or slow down enzyme activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The non-shy tend to suffer at any given point in time from much less internal stress and anxiety than the loveshy. And this fact <i class="calibre4"> may</i> be associated with a healthier enzyme situation in day-to-day living than that with which the loveshy have to deal. Having a healthy constellation of enzymes <i class="calibre4"> may</i> itself help to militate against debilitating loveshyness by enabling an individual to cope more constructively with stress. If, as many biochemists believe, all illnesses and all chronic behavioral mal-adjustments are due to one or more malfunctioning enzymes, then there may be a kind of vicious circle operating that looks something like this: Injections of masculinizing hormones may eventually help to remedy this vicious circle to some extent. Pertinent research currently eminating from East Germany strongly suggests that some remedying of the problem may be accomplished in this way. However, so long as an individual remains highly stressed, his body cannot produce fully healthy enzymes. And without these the body cannot produce appropriate masculinizing hormones on its own. If, as commonly happens, masculinizing hormones help to reduce psychic stress, appropriately injected loveshy individuals may possibly be in a better position to manufacture their own healthy hormones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, chronic tension and stress in a pregnant woman has been found to neutralize certain enzymes that catalyze into action certain hormones that have a masculinizing effect upon parts of the male fetus'</p>
<p class="calibre1">brain which are sensitive to (and which are supposed to expand in response to) male hormones. In an adult or teenager strongly painful</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>60 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and/or frequent anxiety feelings may similarly act to cripple or injure certain enzymes. And this process may have a further feminizing impact upon the individual in addition to undermining his defense system and lowering his resistance to certain types of germs—particularly head cold germs. This may partly explain why the loveshy tend to catch many more head colds and suffer from many more minor health problems than non-shy males do (see chapter titled "Medical Symptoms and the LoveShy"). Thus the bodily defense system of the loveshy may not be functioning at its best because certain enzymes that are crucial to health maintenance have been effectively crippled and neutralized by frequent painful anxiety and stress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, enzymes catalyze the activity of hormones and other crucial bodily chemicals. All disease may indeed be caused in the final analysis by a disordered enzyme. And this may be true for loveshyness as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, congenital disorders precipitated by maternal mental states may interact in a synergistic way with genetic variables to greatly increase the chances of severe loveshyness developing.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Some Related Work on Depression</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the chronic, psychoemotional problems from which people suffer are rooted first and foremost in <i class="calibre4"> biochemical imbalances</i> which, in turn, are passed on genetically from one generation to the next.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of America's long-standing tradition of rugged individualism, the tendency on the part of most people has been to attribute emotional problems to deficits of character and to an unwillingness to assume personal responsibility for one's problems. This viewpoint has been particularly prevalent regarding <i class="calibre4"> males</i> with emotional and behavioral problems. We have always been far more tolerant with women in this respect than we have been with men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let me take depression as a case in point. Depression is hardly unrelated to loveshyness. In fact, 72 percent of the middle-aged loveshys I interviewed and 51 percent of the younger ones checked "frequent feelings of depression" on the medical symptom checklist I administered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the non-shys I interviewed checked this symptom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just a few years ago there was a general feeling that depression was a personality disorder, and that conventional psychiatric techniques (such as the "talking cure") could handle it, and that with the right social impetus people could snap themselves out of it upon their own initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today there is incontrovertible evidence proving beyond any reasonable</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 61</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt that <i class="calibre4"> at least</i> ninety percent of all cases of serious, chronic depression are a byproduct of abnormalities in brain biochemistry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first inkling that depression was a disease and not a mood came in the 1950s. Iproniazid, which is a chemical originally designed to treat tuberculosis patients, was quite unexpectedly found to have a very strong antidepressant effect. Further investigation revealed that depressed persons had abnormalities in the chemical make-up of their brains, and that these abnormalities could be corrected through the use of certain drugs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is how medical researchers speculate that it works. Think of the brain as a mass of electrical energy. Billions of infinitesimal cells called neurons compose this mass. And each one stands alone—almost but not quite touching its neighbors. These cells make up the energy that ceaselessly flows through the brain. Consider two neurons, one of which generates an electrical impulse that it wants to send to its immediately adjacent neighbor. However, the two neurons do not touch; so the electrical impulse has to be carried across the gap by a chemical called a <i class="calibre4"> neurotransmitter. </i> The second neuron which receives the impulse fires; and the process is repeated. Eventually these impulses become the feelings and the thoughts that are a part of human emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been found that in depression there is something wrong with the regulation of these neurotransmitters. The drugs now available compensate for this irregularity by adjusting the flow and the amount of the neurotransmitters. Recent breakthroughs have led to the development of an array of drugs that, singly and in combination, can be aimed at specific chemical reactions in the brain. The drugs that had been used to treat depression ten years ago were crude by comparison with today's drugs; and there were too few of them. Today the choice of drugs is wide, and the possible courses of treatment are quite various.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This new understanding of the brain's chemistry has led to the ability to test for the presence of depression in a body the same way that it is possible to test for diabetes, pneumonia, and other diseases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is exactly what Dr. David Kupfer does. Dr. Kupfer is a pioneer in depression research; and he heads the Depression Research Clinic at Western Psychiatric Hospital in Pittsburgh. For example, in treating a 21-year old woman who had suffered chronic depression most of her life, Dr. Kupfer began with a general checkup. The purpose of this was to rule out any illness that might look like depression. Secondly, he turned to the various tests that have proven valuable for the ascertaining of depression. For example, the <i class="calibre4"> blood</i> of a depressed person shows hormonal abnormalities, and the <i class="calibre4"> urine tests</i> show abnormal levels of brain chemicals. And finally the young woman was given a <i class="calibre4"> sleep test; </i> for this she was wired up to a monitor that printed out the pattern of her brain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>62 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">when she slept. Without fail, a depressed person's sleep has an iden-tifiable pattern of sleep disturbances. Young people who are depressed usually sleep too much, whereas older people cannot fall asleep and/or they wake up excessively early in the morning. In both cases they wake up exhausted and severely lacking in energy—a pattern which seems to be quite prevalent among the ranks of the loveshy, and which may be due to reactive hypoglycemia as well as to biochemically-based depression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The 21-year old woman written about by Dr. Kupfer was quite fortunate in that the first drug administered to her worked to the point of quite totally relieving her of her chronic depression. The drug used in this case was the antidepressant called Aventyl. And in recent years hundreds of chronically depressed people have been fully and permanently relieved of their depression through its use. Dr. Kupfer merely requires patients on this drug to return to the hospital from time to time for a routeine monitoring of drug levels in the blood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the things that medical functionaries are learning these days is the point that chronic depression spares no age group. Much of what we call "senility" in old people is depression. And it can be cured via the same treatment techniques that work for younger people. However, a far more remarkable discovery is the fact that the disease of chronic depression is now being found in children from toddler age through adolescence. And among this very youthful group it is being found <i class="calibre4"> in the same proportion</i> as it is being found in the adult population; namely,  <i class="calibre4"> one in ten. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the damage is just as severe in children as it is in adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, given the very adverse social stimulus value of a depressed ambiance in a young boy (particularly as viewed by the all-male peer group), the damage is often considerably worse for children than it is for adults—because it causes social and psychoemotional development to be launched on a very poor footing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, Drs. Donald McKnew and Leon Cytryn have been engaged in a long-term study of childhood depression. And their findings thus far jibe well with the extensive work of Hans Eysenck and Alexander Thomas on inborn temperament. In 1968, McKnew and Cytryn discovered childhood depression, and today they are finding that the condition is often hereditary. In one of their papers they discuss a 21-month old baby who had long manifested all of the signs of depression including apathy, sadness, listlessness, and lack of interest in his toys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A severely depressed 17-year old boy upon whom they had been working was similarly found to have been very depressed as an infant. Having suffered chronic depression and peer bullying throughout his childhood, he had long been frustrated in his search for treatment by the lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 63</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding of children's depression. As a result of appropriate drug treatment, Dr. McKnew and his staff were able to effectively and permanently cure him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is estimated that approximately 20 million Americans are depressed. Most go untreated or inappropriately treated because depression is too often viewed as a type of personal failure, a flaw of the self and not of the body. The damage to the lives and the families of these people cannot be calculated. For example, it is known that alcoholics and drug abusers are often really suffering from depression. And it has been estimated that 80 percent of the suicides in the United States are the result of biochemically-based depression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An amazingly simple and accurate medical test for diagnosing certain types of depression is presently in the process of revolutionizing psychiatric diagnosis. Known as the dexamethasone suppression test (DST), it is the first biological test that pinpoints the presence of certain quite common forms of depression that are believed to afflict approximately one out of every twenty-five persons, and which are caused by biochemical imbalances in the brain. People with these forms of depression often go from feeling quite normal to feeling extremely depressed for no logical reason. And then they become better without treatment until the next episode.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The DST test can accurately identify about 70 percent of those afflicted with severe, biologically based depression, according to Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michael Feinberg, a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan Mental Health Research Institute at Ann Arbor. To take the DST test, a patient simply swallows a small, yellow tablet containing dexamethasone, which is an artificial steroid. On the following day two blood samples are drawn from the patient at different times. When dexamethasone is given to people who don't have the appropriate forms of biologically based depression, for about 24 hours their bodies stop producing the hormone cortisol, which is a secretion of the adrenal glands. On the other hand, if a patient <i class="calibre4"> is</i> afflicted with biologically based depression, taking the steroid does not shut off cortisol production. Thus some of the cortisol shows up in the blood samples.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, we are beginning to find that many behavioral and psychoemotional problems are rooted in genetically based biochemical imbalances; and that these behavioral and psychoemotional problems are often severely exacerbated (1) by bullying, and (2) by the widely held assumption that the victim can and should assume responsibility for his own problems, pull himself up by his own bootstraps (even when he hasn't got any bootstraps!), and snap himself out of it. The evidence such as that which is reviewed in this book is beginning to point to the strong possibility that chronic, intractable loveshyness is similarly caused</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>64 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">by genetically based biochemical imbalances which lead to bullying and to social avoidance.5</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suicide</p>
<p class="calibre1">It happens much too often: a severely depressed person, or one who has unsuccessfully tried to kill himself, is hospitalized. When doctors conclude that there is no further danger of suicide the patient is sent home. Within a few months the conclusion is proved tragically wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A lab test has now been devised which may accurately differentiate patients who are potentially suicidal from those who are depressed or disturbed, but not likely to kill themselves. The key to this test is <i class="calibre4"> serotonin, </i> which is a chemical messenger that transmits impulses from one nerve cell to another. Although serotonin bathes the surface of the brain and spinal cord, it is an elusive substance which leaves an end product only in the spinal fluid. This end product is known as "5-HIAA" (5-hydroxyindoleatic acid). And a simple laboratory test can now detect</p>
<p class="calibre1">"5-HIAA" in a sample of spinal fluid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scientists at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, working together and separately, have discovered that people whose spinal fluid contains unusually small amounts of "5-HIAA" are at especially high risk of suicide. Whereas statistics have shown that about 2 percent of all hospitalized suicide attempters eventually succeed in killing themselves, a Swedish study of 27 such patients revealed that 22 percent of patients with low "5-HIAA" levels took their lives in the year after testing. An NIMH study of 27 Navy men with low "5-HIAA" has similarly shown that 82 percent eventually attempted suicide.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another Swedish study investigators found that 60 percent of a group of suicide attempters who later killed themselves had low "5-HIAA", whereas in a group of non-suicidal depressed patients only 20</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent had low "5-HIAA". Moreover, impulsive and aggressive men who chose violent means of suicide had especially low levels of this biochemical—which some scientists are now dubbing "the suicide factor".</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, 36 percent of the 300 loveshy men studied for this book had given serious consideration to taking their own lives.  <i class="calibre4"> Zero</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> (nobody) of the 200 non-shy men I interviewed had ever given any thought to suicide, and none had ever experienced frequent bouts of depression.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 65</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Biogenic Amines</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the late 1970s, one of the most important conclusions to which psychiatric research has led is that certain brain chemicals called <i class="calibre4"> biogenic</i> <i class="calibre4">amines</i> have a very strong bearing upon the control of mood. For example, in one study it was found that animals became <i class="calibre4"> socially inactive</i> when they were given drugs that diminished the brain's ability to produce biogenic amines. In essence, the tested animals were found to manifest one of the key symptoms of depression. Animal studies as well as research with psychiatric patients have also indicated that deficiencies in biogenic amines tend to be associated with low energy level, with irritability, with <i class="calibre4">anhedonia</i> (a diminished ability to experience pleasure or emotion), and with strong feelings of anger (see Wender and Klein, 1981).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The biogenic amine theory of depression attributes severe cases of depression (when there is no environmentally-based reason for depressed feelings) to an underactivity of certain nerve cells. Some of these nerve cells are intimately connected with the experience of pleasure; and the neurotransmitters of these nerve cells are the biogenic amines. The theory holds that such underactivity might be due to (a) a deficient production of the neurotransmitters, or (b) excessive breakdown of the neurotransmitter before it is released, or (c) inability to release the neurotransmitter, or (d) a decreased response sensitivity of the stimulated nerve cell. This same theory holds that <i class="calibre4"> mania</i> represents the reverse side of the coin—with <i class="calibre4"> too much</i> of the critical biogenic amines available.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The differences in the actions of stimulants and antidepressants on both normal individuals and patients with biologically-based depression are not as yet fully understood by researchers. The antidepressant drugs will usually relieve depression in <i class="calibre4"> vital depressives</i> (i.e., in those with biologically-based depression), but will <i class="calibre4"> not</i> produce feelings of euphoria in persons who are not depressed (e.g., in "normal" individuals). Thus, such drugs are not abusable or habit-forming. In fact, the action of these drugs can be roughly compared to the action of aspirin—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which lowers body temperature when fever is present but does not noticeably lower the body temperature of a person whose temperature is normal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with biologically-based depression ("vital depression") do not develop a <i class="calibre4"> tolerance</i> to these antidepressant drugs—as they indeed would to cocaine or to amphetamines. When contemporary antidepressant drugs work, the depressed patient does not need to take increasingly larger doses in order to obtain the same effect. Hence, these new antidepressant drugs may operate to temporarily repair a defective "thermostat" in the biogenic amine metabolizing section of the brain. Such</p>

<p class="calibre1">an explanation would account for these drugs' lack of effect upon normal persons and their very profound effect upon persons with depressive states.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychiatrists Paul Wender and Donald Klein (1981) suggest that many people with <i class="calibre4"> low self-esteem</i> (especially in cases where feelings of low self-worth are difficult to explain on the basis of personal history) may indeed suffer from undetected biologically-based <i class="calibre4"> "vital depression". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the positive side, the question as to whether or not they are indeed actually suffering from this may be answered through the administration of these antidepressant drugs. Simply put, if medication that usually only sedates normal persons serves to increase self-esteem in a given individual, we can be relatively certain that the feelings of low self-esteem were the result of faulty brain biochemistry rather than the learned residues of unfortunate early personal experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though traditional "talking cure" psychotherapy has never been shown to be particularly effective in the treatment of severe depression, many contemporary psychotherapists continue to be convinced (on faith) of the validity of their ideology that chronic depressed feelings are due to psychoemotional conflicts dating from infancy and childhood, and that such conflicts typically involve much guilt and hostility. The efficacy of modern antidepressant drugs in reversing depressed moods cogently and incisively calls into question the reasonableness of attributing these illnesses to psychological conflicts. In essence, a simple pharmacological treatment has been found to work quickly and effectively for depressed patients whereas the exasperating business of the patient trying to release imputed "guilt" through talking and insight usually fails.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with some cases of low self-esteem, recent data has suggested that cases of <i class="calibre4"> separation anxiety</i> in children tend to be associated with the biologically-based depression syndrome. Thus, when psychiatrist Donald Klein studied patients with agoraphobias he noted that when younger they had quite typically suffered from overpowering homesickness and "school phobia". Throughout virtually all of this century such feelings in children have been explained on the basis of less than healthy family dynamics and parent-child interaction patterns. Now a very different picture is beginning to emerge as to what <i class="calibre4"> actually causes</i> these painfully distressing feelings and behaviors in children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When Klein discovered that separation-anxious agoraphobics responded well to antidepressant medication, he hypothesized that the younger versions of such patients (the severely homesick child and the school phobic child) might quite similarly respond favorably to treatment with that same medication. So he and his wife Rachel Gittelman-Klein (1971) designed a research study involving school-phobic children who</p>
