<p class="calibre1">had not responded well to the usual treatment techniques of behavior therapy, play therapy, and "talking cure" psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The administration of behavior therapy alone resulted in only about half of the children being able to return to school. But once back at school the children often continued to feel very distressed; and they experienced significant difficulties in being accepted by their peers. On the other hand, when the behavior therapy techniques <i class="calibre4"> were combined</i> with antidepressant medication, the children's anxiety and depressive complaints diminished or disappeared; and the children not only returned to school but did so happily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the antidepressant medication had greatly benefitted the children's subjective state, thus permitting an anxiety-free separation. The implication of these and related findings is that traditional psychodynamic reasoning typically advanced to explain separation anxiety in children has little to do with its basic cause— <i class="calibre4">a deficiency of biogenic</i> <i class="calibre4">amines</i> and a defective "thermostat" in the biogenic amine-metabolizing section of the brain.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Anxiety Disease</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some five percent (one in twenty) of all Americans suffer from a <i class="calibre4">biologically-based, </i> medical problem that has come to be known in medical circles as "anxiety disease". In his recent book entitled ANXIETY DISEASE, psychiatrist/physician David V. Sheehan explains that better than 90 percent of all victims can be completely cured of all symptoms by administration of a drug called "nardil". Sheehan goes on to quite clearly and incisively document how anxiety disease victims have a "different brain-chemical activity" than do unafflicted individuals. Sheehan also shows how intravenous administration of a certain drug can inside of fifteen minutes set off a severe anxiety attack in an afflicted individual (i.e., a person with the "anxiety disease" brain biochemical activity), whereas the same quantity of this same drug will have no effect at all on the 95 percent of the population that is unafflicted with this problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with anxiety disease will characteristically be susceptible to having an attack at virtually any time. They typically average four attacks per week; and occasionally these will come even during sleep. Thus, a person might wake up in the middle of the night suffering from a severe attack of anxiety for no apparent reason at all. Loved ones might label such an experience a mere "nightmare" or a "bad dream". But just as a geyser might go off four times per week because that is how often the water pressure reaches the required degree of sheer force, for an anxiety disease victim that is how often the brain biochemistry reaches such a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>68 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">degree of imbalance as to trigger off the anxiety attack. If the victim happens to be in bed at the time, his/her attack will be attributed to a bad dream. If he/she is in a crowded store it will be attributed to <i class="calibre4"> agoraphobia. </i> In either case, the difficulty <i class="calibre4"> cannot</i> be successfully treated via behavior therapy alone, or via any of the "talking therapies". Simply put, appropriate pharmacological treatment is a mandatory <i class="calibre4"> sine qua non</i> for complete and effective, permanent remission of symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agoraphobia is one of many problems that has long been quite incorrectly viewed as stemming purely from psychoemotional causes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The tradition in the helping professions as well as in the wider society has long been to <i class="calibre4"> blame the victim</i> instead of focusing upon genetics, brain biochemistry, or even upon difficult stresses that might be endemic in the victim's <i class="calibre4"> life situation. </i> This moralistic approach (rooted in the ethic of</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rugged individualism" and personal responsibility <i class="calibre4"> for everything)</i> characteristically resulted in only very temporary and quite ephemoral "cures".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, after spending thousands of dollars on various "talking cures"</p>
<p class="calibre1">the victim would still be plagued by the uncomfortably frequent manifestation of symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An interesting earmark of anxiety disease is that frequently the victim would <i class="calibre4"> learn to associate</i> severe anxiety feelings with the <i class="calibre4"> situation</i> in which he/she happened (often quite by chance) to be located at the time of an attack. Such learned associations are especially likely to develop in impressionable young children. Thus, severely painful and frightening anxiety feelings might become associated by a young person with being in a dark bedroom, with being in a crowded supermarket, with being in a situation far away from an exit door, with being in the presence of a dog, cat or rabbit, with involvement in some harmless activity,  <i class="calibre4"> or</i> perhaps maybe even with informal, sociable interaction vis-a-vis the opposite sex. In view of the fact that stressed feelings (i.e., feelings of stress that might accrue from sheer inexperience) can easily set off one of these anxiety attacks in a biochemically susceptible person, it is distinctly possible that severe and intractable shyness vis-a-vis the opposite sex in informal situations might be spearheaded by a synergistic combination of anxiety disease <i class="calibre4"> in interaction with</i> normal stress resulting from behavioral inexperience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, severely loveshy men do not appear to be agoraphobic; nor do they appear to have a history of having unprovoked "panic attacks" or unprovoked spells of anxiety. However, a great deal of the burgeoning medical/biochemical literature on anxiety disease may still be of considerable relevance to the problem of severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, severely loveshy men may indeed have a different genetic structure and brain/body biochemistry than the rest of us—and from those who can manage to work through their shyness problems</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 69</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the aid of a few normal psychotherapeutic (talking cure) sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, it is quite possible that <i class="calibre4"> in some people</i> anxiety disease <i class="calibre4"> per se</i> manifests itself only in childhood and then dissipates gradually away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If such is the case, then it is distinctly possible that biologically based anxiety attacks might have in some loveshys precipitated the learned association of anxiety feelings with social assertiveness and with informal heterosexual interaction. As children, stress created by social inexperience may have triggered off this possibly learned association. Habits of social nonparticipation wrought by an above average anxiety-prone brain/</p>
<p class="calibre1">body chemistry may thus underlie severe loveshyness in adult males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such adults may not quite have "anxiety disease"; but their brain biochemistry may be all too similar to that of those who do have this medical problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Sheehan underscores the importance of making a conceptual distinction between <i class="calibre4"> "endogenous anxiety" </i> and <i class="calibre4"> "exogenous anxiety". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Endogenous" comes from a Greek word which means "to be born or produced from within". The central problem in cases of endogenous anxiety springs from some source <i class="calibre4"> inside</i> the individual's body, rather than as a response to a situation outside the person. Thus, panic or severe anxiety attacks with no source of provocation outside of the victim's body would represent a pure and undiluted case of "endogenous anxiety".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> exogenous anxiety</i> is provoked anxiety, and it represents a reaction to subjectively perceived stress outside the individual. In its pure form there is no genetic or biochemical basis underlying exogenous anxiety. Indeed, all humans suffer from exogenous anxiety from time to time; it might be construed as a quite normal reaction to stress. Because what is <i class="calibre4"> seen</i> as stressful is a <i class="calibre4"> subjective</i> matter and is strictly up to each individual and unique person, some people experience exogenous anxiety extremely frequently as well as extremely painfully. Other people with approximately the same sorts of stresses impacting on their lives experience relatively infrequent bouts of anxiety which they perceive as quite mild and manageable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As useful as this conceptual distinction is in terms of helping us to better understand anxiety, it also entails some serious dangers. First, it is highly unlikely that very many anxiety cases can accurately be classsified as being either <i class="calibre4"> totally</i> endogenous or <i class="calibre4"> totally</i> exogenous. What we actually have here is a <i class="calibre4"> continuum</i> with endogenous anxiety resting at one extreme and exogenous anxiety at the other. The person with completely endogenous anxiety suffers anxiety or panic spells for no apparent external reason.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, I would contend that endogenous (genetically and biochemically based) anxiety disease is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> limited to those with such</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>70 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">unprovoked anxiety or panic attacks, and that the key reason why some people learned to subjectively perceive certain social stimuli (e.g., intimacy with the opposite sex or participation in "rough and tumble" sports) as painfully threatening in the first place is that they have an unusually low native anxiety threshold. Further, the basis of this very low native anxiety threshold would be a very high amount of electrical activity in the <i class="calibre4"> locus ceruleus</i> region of the brain—quite irrespective of whether or not the anxiety provoking stimulus is a much desired attractive woman or something else. Labeling loveshyness as being exclusively indicative of exogenous anxiety will inevitably result in a dearth of compassionate understanding directed toward the victim; and it will result in a grossly insufficient array of therapeutic modalities being engineered and used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">David Sheehan's work on severe anxiety has provided strong documentation suggestive of a genetic basis for the disorder. Statistical studies were done on the prevalence of the anxiety disorder among the relatives of affected people. It was found that those who had a close relative with the condition were more likely to develop it than those who did not. This finding was strong enough for it to be highly unlikely that it was due to chance alone. It also seemed that the closer the biological relationship to the affected person, the greater the likelihood of developing the anxiety disorder. Special mathematical techniques were used to analyze the family trees of affected families. The evidence suggested that the proneness to the anxiety disorder fit closely, though not perfectly, with a <i class="calibre4"> dominant-gene inheritance pattern. </i> This inheritance pattern would allow it to be passed down by one parent, and would not require it to be inherited from both sides of the family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Thomas J. Bouchard of the University of Minnesota, Dr. Sheehan (at the Harvard University Medical School) has also studied twins with the anxiety condition. Sheehan's preliminary findings suggest that there is a greater tendency for both twins to have the anxiety disease if they are identical than if they are nonidentical (fraternal) twins. Twin studies such as these are frequently used to sort out the relative contributions of environmental (stress and learning) factors from genetic factors. If a disease is learned or due to an environmental stress, then growing up at the same time in the same family, exposed to the same environment, should result in both twins having it equally, whether they are identical or not. On the other hand, if anxiety disease is mainly genetic in its basis, you would expect both of the identical twins who have an identical genetic makeup to have it together. The findings in Sheehan's twin study suggest that genetic inheritance forces tend to outweigh the effects of the enrivonment in their overall contribution to the disorder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is possible that such a genetic weakness could give rise to biochemical abnormalities, and that these in turn could lead to the symptoms</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 71</p>
<p class="calibre1">the victim feels physically. As' far as delineating what the precise, biochemical abnormalities of the anxiety actually are, the best guesses so far (on the basis of the extensive amount of research work that has been done) involve certain nerve endings and receptors in the central nervous system which produce and receive chemical messengers that stimulate and excite the brain. These nerve endings manufacture naturally occurring stimulants called catecholamines. It is believed that in the anxiety disease the nerve endings overfire to a profuse extent. In essence, the nerve endings tend to work too hard, and in so doing they overproduce these stimulants along with perhaps others as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time there are nerve endings and receptors that have the opposite effect: they produce naturally occurring tranquilizers called inhibitory neurotransmitters which serve to inhibit and calm down the nerve firing of the brain. From the research knowledge we have been able to acquire so far, it appears that the neurotransmitters or the receptors may be deficient, either in quality or in quantity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why are they deficient? Several other substances regulate the firing of the nerves, acting like accelerators or brakes on the firing process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These substances include prostaglandins, which are local regulators, and ions, especially calcium ions, which flow across cell membranes. Enzymes regulate how fast these substances are produced and destroyed in the nerve endings. There is some evidence suggesting that all of these substances may be involved in some way in the malfunctions that produce the anxiety disease. A chain of events apparently runs from the inherited gene or genes through the cell nucleus to the cell membrane to the nerve ending and the chemicals it uses, involving some or all of the above mechanisms. As ongoing research continues to provide us with more and more answers, undoubtedly other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters will be identified that play a role in that chain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recent research has documented some fascinating differences in the brain blood flow between panic-attack-prone and <i class="calibre4"> non</i> panic-attack-prone persons. A Washington University (St. Louis) medical research team examined seven individuals who had severe anxiety attacks in response to injections of lactate, three who were not lactate sensitive, and six with no history of anxiety disease. Using positron emission tomography scans, the researchers measured blood flow in seven areas of the brain that are thought to control panic and anxiety reactions. In one of these areas, the <i class="calibre4"> parahippocampal gyrus, </i> the researchers observed a startling difference between the lactate-sensitive patients and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In every lactate-sensitive patient, the blood flow on the <i class="calibre4"> right side</i> of the gyrus was much higher than on the left side. This difference was not observed in the other two groups. There is typically a high degree of symmetry in the brain; thus, this observed difference went well beyond the normal range of that symmetry. In <i class="calibre4"> every instance</i> the pattern of blood</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>72 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">flow was different than normal, and the flow on the right side was higher than on the left.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It appears from further research that this brain abnormality consistently distinguishes lactate-sensitive panic sufferers from other people. Researchers indicate that it may reflect an exaggeration of the normal hemispheric specialization in part of the brain important to the expression of anxiety. Thus, the differences in blood flow between hemispheres probably is connected with differences in metabolic rate. Any changes in blood flow reflect differences in the activity of nerve cells on the two sides.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As per discussions in chapters 15 and 16 of this book, loveshy men are far more likely than unafflicted individuals to have milk allergies and sensitivities. Thus, upon drinking milk many of them develop a copious abundance of very thick, foul-tasting saliva. Milk, of course, contains a heavy amount of lactate. In this regard research is needed to determine the extent to which milk intake might influence anxiety-proneness and social avoidance in young children—especially boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chapter 10 of this book will provide ample documentation of the point that most loveshy males tend to avoid strenuous forms of exercise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interestingly, one of the main byproducts of muscle activity is <i class="calibre4"> lactate</i> which, as indicated above, is a substance to which low anxiety threshold people tend to be highly sensitive. Thus, it is not unreasonable to suspect that this lactate sensitivity might well represent an important reason (even if a minor one) as to why loveshys as children tend to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rough and tumble" play, and tend to prefer less energetic "feminine"</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1966 Dr. Ferris Pitts found that administering an intravenous infusion of sodium lactate to victims of unusually low anxiety threshold served to almost immediately bring on spells of painful anxiety and even panic, just like the victims' original symptoms. It is possible to turn the anxiety condition on simply by injecting this substance, which is produced in everyone's body in response to exercise. If you give sodium lactate to normal persons,  <i class="calibre4"> nothing happens; </i> with anxiety disease victims, turning off the lactate infusions stops the symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recently, three families of drugs known as (1) the MAO inhibitors, including "nardil", (2) the tricyclics, and (3) alprazolam, have been found to attenuate the anxiety spells that are induced by lactate. A patient sensitive to lactate could be given a lactate infusion after treatment with any of these three drugs and <i class="calibre4"> not develop the very strong and painful anxiety</i> <i class="calibre4">feelings. </i> Thus, these drugs change the anxiety-prone person's metabolism in such a way that they lose their abnormal sensitivity (allergy) to lactate, and hence respond once again more like normal people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since 1980, other drugs and food substances have been found to have the same anxiety-attack-inducing effects as lactate. These substances</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 73</p>
<p class="calibre1">include isoproterenol and yohimbine. The next few years of research effort should uncover a great deal of valuable new knowledge about the drug and food substances which issue forth anxiety symptoms (or which <i class="calibre4">lower</i> the anxiety threshold), and those which serve to extinguish anxiety symptoms or <i class="calibre4"> raise</i> the anxiety threshold. The best general summary as to what is now known about the genetic and biochemical basis of anxiety and its pharmacological treatment can be found in Dr. David V. Sheehan's 1984 book titled THE ANXIETY DISEASE.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally, carbon dioxide has also been found to be related to severe anxiety attacks. It appears that anxiety-prone individuals are less able than nonafflicted people to properly and effectively metabolize the carbon dioxide that they breath. This difficulty might well be due to an enzyme deficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in women, the hormone progesterone has been found to be linked to anxiety attacks. Afflicted individuals are less capable than others of metabolizing the progesterone hormone. And this problem might well be linked to the premenstrual stress syndrome ("PMS") from which some women suffer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, neuroscientist Dr. Eugene Redmond of Yale University, was able to conclude from his research that panic, anxiety and fear may be controlled by changes in <i class="calibre4"> norepinephrine</i> metabolism in the <i class="calibre4"> locus ceruleus</i> region of the brain. Locating an isolated brain area such as this (i.e., one that is vulnerable to the influences of substances in the blood <i class="calibre4"> due</i> <i class="calibre4">to its lack of a protective blood-brain barrier)</i> provides us with potentially valuable information about the physiological roots of severe anxiety attacks, and of ultimately the fear of anxiety (anticipatory anxiety). In essence, it would appear from Redmond's studies that severe anxiety feelings may often result from a <i class="calibre4"> hyperactivity</i> of the neurons in the <i class="calibre4"> locus</i> <i class="calibre4">coeruleus</i> section of the brain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, Redmond implanted an electrode in the locus coeruleus section of the lower brain of a group of stumptailed monkeys. When this electrode was stimulated electrically, the monkeys behaved as if they were panicked, anxious, fearful, or in impending danger. In contrast, damaging this small brain center in the monkeys had the opposite effect: the monkeys without a functioning locus coeruleus showed an absence of emotional response to threats, and they were without apparent fear of approaching humans or dominant monkeys.  <i class="calibre4"> Socially, they became much</i> <i class="calibre4">more aggressive; </i> and they moved around in their cages much more than before and more than normal monkeys. In view of the fact that the locus coeruleus has the highest density of norepinephrine-containing neurons in the central nervous system, Redmond concluded from his work that panic and fear result from <i class="calibre4"> a hyperactivity of these neurons in the brain. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that anxiety and fear could be switched on and off in this fashion conveys the idea of how <i class="calibre4"> physical</i> the anxiety problem may well</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>74 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">be. The site of the locus coeruleus is one of the most permeable areas of the brain, and hence it is one of the most sensitive areas to local metabolic changes. When the particular biochemical changes associated with the anxiety disease occur, this part of the brain may be the most sensitive to the changes and may be stimulated to produce its characteristic fear reactions.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">D o p a m i n e</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is considerable evidence from the work of Wender and Klein (1981) that highly emotionally sensitive introverts suffer from excessive <i class="calibre4">dopamine</i> activity in the brain. Dopamine is a brain chemical which in normal amounts is healthy. Too much or too little of it can and does create problems. Very inhibited, highly sensitive people have too much brain dopamine activity, and may also have brain cells that are unusually hypersensitive to this brain chemical.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Schizophrenia</p>
<p class="calibre1">Schizophrenia constitutes another psychiatric problem about which traditional psychiatric wisdom appears to have been quite false and misleading. For example, schizophrenia had long been believed to be a <i class="calibre4">learned</i> disorder. However, recent research has shown that certain forms of schizophrenia can be one-hundred percent cured virtually immediately through <i class="calibre4"> kidney dialysis! </i> This finding was arrived at quite by accident.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A 21-year old woman with what appeared to be a hopeless case of schizophrenia (requiring lifelong mental hospitalization) came down with a kidney disease. The doctors put this mental patient on a kidney dialysis machine in order to clean her blood and treat the kidney problem. And much to their dismay they found that what had been a veritable human vegetable at the outset of the dialysis process was now a few hours later behaving remarkable normally-—as though she had just awakened from a long and restful sleep!</p>
<p class="calibre1">It needs to be stressed, of course, that only certain forms of schizophrenia have been found to be treatable via kidney dialysis. However, I think the fact that <i class="calibre4"> any</i> substantial number of cases can be <i class="calibre4"> effectively and</i> <i class="calibre4">totally cured</i> this way is quite remarkable and extremely heartening. Less than a decade ago it had been blythly assumed by almost all psychiatrists that curing schizophrenia by "removing something bad" from the afflicted person's body was nothing more than a fairy tale delusional fantasy commonly dreamed up by psychotherapy patients who wish to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 75</p>
<p class="calibre1">assuming personal responsibility for their problems. The very idea of a biochemical or surgical cure had been viewed by almost all psychiatrists as a "cop out"—as a refusal on the part of the patient to face up to his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her emotional problems and to assume personal responsibility for overcoming them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone who has studied chronic loveshyness realizes that its victims have many strongly schizoid tendencies. Schizophrenia is simply a variety* of schizoid tendencies that is so severe that the victim has lost touch with reality and can no longer go to work or attend school. The schizoid neurotic is a loner who has <i class="calibre4"> not</i> lost contact with reality; he is a person who merely avoids informal interpersonal contact with other people. He does this (1) because he has a very low inborn anxiety threshold which, possibly due to biochemical anomalies in the brain, makes him experience anxiety much more severely, painfully and frequently than most people do, and (2) because he has <i class="calibre4"> learned to associate</i> these painful internal feelings with being around people, rather than with being around something else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So what is the underlying basis of a person's learning of these avoidance tendencies? This side of the picture will be covered in full detail in the next chapter. For now suffice it to say that the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> biochemical imbalances which cause the neurotransmitters in the brain of the depressed person to malfunction, may also help to create the genetically rooted inborn temperament we call <i class="calibre4"> melancholia</i> (figure 1, page 41) which, in turn, appears to constitute a primary antecedent of chronic loveshyness. Simply put, the loveshy man may well be a victim of many of the same brain-based biochemical imbalances that characterize to a much worse extent certain varieties of psychotic schizophrenics.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final example of the recently discovered fact that many psychoemotional problems have a genetically rooted and/or biochemical base, let us consider obsessive-compulsive disorders. People with <i class="calibre4"> obsessions</i> find it very difficult to get certain useless thoughts out of their minds. In essence, they are extremely anxiety-ridden about forgetting certain objectively unimportant items which could just as well be forgotten without any adverse consequences accruing as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with <i class="calibre4"> compulsions</i> have an extremely strong drive to engage in some form of behavior or ritual, even when that behavior or ritual does not need to be done. The compulsive person performs the needless behavior anyway because failure to do so would create too much strong anxiety. For most compulsives the energy sapped up by engaging in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>76 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless acts is <i class="calibre4"> less</i> taxing than the anxiety he/she would have to suffer if he/she did not engage in the useless act or ritual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many childhood tics are essentially compulsions. And tics were especially prevalent in the childhood backgrounds of the 300 loveshy men interviewed for this study. For example, one loveshy man had had a childhood tic wherein he would repeatedly punch his chin, even to the point (sometimes) of drawing blood. Another man had had a nagging compulsion to frequently check his post card collection, even though he knew from an intellectual standpoint that all of his post cards were there, and no one could have stolen any of them. Avoiding sidewalk cracks or sidewalk dividers had been an especially prevalent compulsive tic among these loveshy men; and some of them were still affected by it even now as adults. Another loveshy man had driven his elementary school teachers "up the wall" by momentarily stooping down every ten or twelve steps he took. In other words, everytime he took a walk of any length he would be observed constantly popping up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several other loveshy men had had the sort of compulsive tic which made them constantly touch corridor walls as they walked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with compulsions are usually afflicted with obsessions as well. Similarly, those afflicted with obsessions usually suffer from some compulsions. The point to all of this is that if ever there was a disorder that was <i class="calibre4"> learned</i> rather than innate, obsessive-compulsive problems would appear to exemplify it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet during the past five years neurologists and biochemists have uncovered strong evidence indicating that this too is a genetically and biochemically rooted disorder which may very soon be fully treatable with certain kinds of drugs. Of course, the specific substantive content of the obsession or compulsion <i class="calibre4"> has to be learned. </i> But the drive itself to own compulsions or obsessions is biologically rooted and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> learned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As with depression, the interview data obtained for the research upon which this book is based indicated a far greater prevalence of compulsions and obsessions among the ranks of the loveshys than among the ranks of the non-shys. Of course, it has long been known that obsessions and compulsions dissipate to some extent with age. For example, children are generally more vulnerable than adults to tics of one sort or another. However, as children the loveshys interviewed for this book had had many more compulsive tics than the non-shys; and these compulsive tics tended to have been far more grossly apparent in the behavior of the loveshys than in that of the non-shys. The relatively few nervous tics suffered by the non-shys had been of a sort which had created relatively little public notice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now as adults the loveshys continue to suffer from many more obsessions and compulsions than the non-shys. Several of the interview</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate <i class="calibre4"> 77</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">questions employed for this research had a bearing upon the issue of obsessive-compulsive problems. For example, I asked each of my respondents for his reaction to this statement: "I frequently become very upset without outwardly showing it when people interrupt my fantasy life." Fully 81 percent of the 300 loveshy men indicated that this statement was <i class="calibre4"> true</i> for them. In contrast, only 4 percent of the 200 non-shy men indicated that the statement had any validity for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I requested reactions to this statement: "Even when I read for pleasure, I find that I write many more notes in the margins than most people do." And again, only 4 percent of the non-shy men said "yes", compared to fully 41 percent of the loveshys. I similarly asked each respondent to give his reaction to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can become extremely upset when I can't remember what I had been thinking about a few minutes ago before some distraction." Fully 63</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the loveshy men agreed with this statement compared to a mere 2 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Difficulty concentrating is another major symptom of affliction with useless obsessions. And 84 percent of the loveshy men agreed that they very frequently experienced serious difficulty concentrating while reading or studying. Despite their very active social lives, only 6 percent of the non-shy men indicated similar difficulties with concentration while reading or studying.  <i class="calibre4"> External</i> distractions appeared to bother the loveshy men a great deal less than <i class="calibre4"> internal</i> ones. Many of the loveshys indicated that they could read or study despite the presence of many different kinds of noises. Their <i class="calibre4"> real</i> problem was that of dealing with the host of uninvited thoughts and obsessions that kept constantly bombarding their conscious minds as they were trying to read or study.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The obsessions and compulsions of many of the loveshys created very real learning and study problems for them. Even though many of them claimed knowledge (from an intellectual standpoint) of speed reading techniques, their compulsion to underline and make useless notes (based upon these obsessive thoughts) obviated their using these techniques. In fact, about a third of the men advised me that they could talk faster than they could read. One man, in fact, could talk about five times faster than he could read. This man had attained a Masters degree in psychology and was considered a plodder. By his own admission he usually had to spend approximately five times more of his time in the library studying than he would have had to spend if he did not have the distracting obsessive and compulsive thought patterns. Again, highly debilitating albeit less serious obsessions and compulsions afflicted most of the loveshy men interviewed for this book. And as children many of them were seen as "underachievers" and as "under-utilizers of time"</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>78 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The material covered in this chapter has clear implications for psychotherapeutic treatment. Even today most psychiatrists and clinical psychologists try to convince patients whose symptoms remain refractory to treatment over long periods of time that on an "unconscious"</p>
<p class="calibre1">level change is not truly desired. In essence, the loveshy client is told that he is "not yet ready" to change. The implicit assumption, of course, is that the unconscious mind might eventually permit change, but that it is not yet ready to do so now. Another implicit assumption is that the wishes of the unconscious mind should be accorded priority over the wishes of the conscious, rational, goal-setting part of the mind. Despite the fact that research evidence <i class="calibre4"> does not support</i> their view, the belief remains widespread among psychiatrists that people "need" their symptoms; and that if you "take away" a person's symptoms he/she will generate new and possibly even worse ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many psychiatrists believe that if a patient remains refractory to help over long periods of time, there must be something untruthful and fallacious about that patient's consciously stated goals. In essence, the problem lies with the patient,  <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> with the psychotherapeutic method.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This attitude, which remains quite dominant among psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, assumes that the patient who is refractory to treatment has an ultra-strong set of defenses—and that in time that set of defenses might be made to crumble to the point where constructive change might become possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe this "force a square peg into a round hole" attitude represents a major barrier against the development of new, far more effective psychotherapeutic technologies. In short, if a person is not helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">"because his defense system remains too strong" and <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> because the therapeutic methodology itself is wanting, then there need be no motive towards the development of better therapeutic modalities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is for this reason that virtually all chronically loveshy men who commence psychotherapy sooner or later drop out of it without having been helped by the process one wit. To be sure, not all loveshy men give up so easily as far as their hopes and fantasies pertinent to psychotherapy are concerned. One 36-year old loveshy man I interviewed had had 13 years of one-on-one psychotherapy from six different therapists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His most recent attempt had been with a behavior therapist. And after seven months of treatment that therapist came to the same conclusion to which all of the prior therapists had arrived. In essence, this severely loveshy man was told that his defense system was too strong, and that he really did not truly want to have a woman to love. And for the past</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>LoveShyness and the Nature Versus Nurture Debate 79</p>
<p class="calibre1">nine years this loveshy man has maintained his resolve not to allow himself to get roped in on any more "psychotherapy".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite clearly, if chronic and intractable loveshyness is biologically rooted as the evidence presented in this chapter very strongly suggests, then none of the traditional methods of psychotherapy or of behavior therapy are going to be of any viable service. Other methods must be devised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this chapter has been to introduce the major evidence regarding the biological basis of inherited, fearful behavior. It was shown that all biological characteristics having <i class="calibre4"> observable</i> concomitants entail <i class="calibre4"> social consequences. </i> Biologically based traits and physical appearances invariably incorporate some sort of <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value. </i> And this social stimulus value can vary from being enormously favorable down to being enormously unfavorable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, all biologically based human traits are to a greater or lesser extent <i class="calibre4"> elastic, </i> NOT rigid. All traits can and do change in response to societal reactions, positive and negative labelings, and social definitions. Much of what we perceive as "reality" is <i class="calibre4"> socially constructed. </i> It is constructed by the ways in which significant societal agents such as parents, peers and teachers, respond and react to the biological givens of life. These biological givens contain great elasticity and potential for both favorable and unfavorable change as we shall see in the next chapter.6</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Notes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. According to Paul Pilkonis' analysis, fully two-thirds of the male clients treated at Philip Zimbardo's "Shyness Clinic" (Stanford University), possess native temperaments which place them <i class="calibre4"> outside</i> the <i class="calibre4"> melancholic quadrant</i> of the Eysenck Cross. This represents a major reason in support of my contention that very few of Zimbardo's clients are <i class="calibre4"> genuinely</i> <i class="calibre4">shy. </i> Yet despite the mildness of their problems, fully 50 percent of Zimbardo's clients drop out of the "Shyness Clinic" program because of an inability to do the required homework exercises.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Thus, the nonstability-stability (high versus low emotionality) dimension appears to be governed by the innate nature of a person's <i class="calibre4"> autonomic nervous system, </i> whereas the extroversion-introversion dimension appears to be governed by the innate nature of a person's <i class="calibre4"> central nervous system. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">3. This represents a key reason why I believe inhibited and uninhibited children should not be either required or expected to play together in the same peer groups. Simply put, boys whose inborn nature is inhibited tend to flourish best when they are permitted to play in noncompetitive coeducational peer groups that are comprised of both girls and <i class="calibre4">inhibited</i> boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. With regard to a variety of personality characteristics that are measured by widely used personality inventories, S. G. Vandenberg carried out a remarkably complete tab-ulation comprising 185 pairs of monozygotic twins and 908 pairs of dizygotic twins. Eleven tests measured personality traits, needs, and attitudes in factors of many kinds: for example, those labeled energetic, conformity, masculinity, femininity, dependency needs, punitive attitude, responsibility, and so forth. In all but eight of the 101 variables, the monozygotic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>80 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">pairs were more alike than the dizygotic pairs. Interestingly, the kinds of variables that most often emerged in both members of identical-twin pairs seemed to measure the <i class="calibre4"> degree</i> <i class="calibre4">of sociability and energy, </i> a concept very close to that of degree of extraversion-introversion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another investigation of twins—79 pairs of monozygotic twins and 68 pairs of dizygotic twins—Irving Gottesman demonstrated a strong genetic component for social introversion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, in a longitudinal twin study that was conducted by Robert Dworkin, the traits of anxiety-proneness and dependency were found to be highly heritable. This was found by Dworkin to be the case for a sample of teenagers as well as for a sample of adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Other evidence of biological factors where none were heretofore suspected includes that of certain subgroups of children with severe separation anxiety that prevents them from going to school or camp or staying overnight with friends or relatives. According to the work of psychiatrists Paul Wender and Donald Klein, the specific response of such children to antidepressant medication has been impressive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. To untangle the knot between family and genetic influences, psychologists Denise Daniels and Robert Plomin published a fascinating new study in 1985. Simply put, their data provide additional very strong evidence of a <i class="calibre4"> genetic</i> factor underlying shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using several personality and temperament questionnaries, they compared 152 families who had adopted children with 120 families who were bringing up their own babies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of the parents rated how shy their baby had been at 12 months and at 24 months of age. They described how many unfamiliar social situations the baby might encounter at home; and they also reported on their own shy or outgoing temperament. Husbands and wives also rated each other. In addition, Daniels and Plomin asked the adopted babies'</p>
<p class="calibre1">biological mothers to rate their own degree of shyness and sociability.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most striking findings of this study (sponsored by the Colorado Adoption Project) was a strong resemblance between the degree of shyness of the biological mothers and their adopted-away babies at the age of 24 months (the babies had all been adopted within three months of birth). This result must be considered particularly impressive because the biological mothers' scores had been derived from self-report questionnaires completed before the birth of the infant. And the infants' scores represented ratings by the adoptive parents <i class="calibre4"> over two years later. </i> Daniels and Plomin assert that this constitutes strong evidence of a genetic connection between the personalities of parents and their infants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chapter Postscript Regarding Monoamine Oxidase</p>
<p class="calibre1">On August 12, 1986, NBC televised a show titled "Nature and Nurture" which was hosted by Phil Donahue. On this program it was announced that it had indeed been found that the brain chemical <i class="calibre4"> monoamine oxidase</i> clearly differentiates extroverts from introverts. Extroverts tend to have <i class="calibre4"> very low levels</i> of this brain chemical. In constrast,  <i class="calibre4"> shy,</i> <i class="calibre4">inhibited people tend to have very high levels of monoamine oxidase in their</i> <i class="calibre4">brains. </i> This finding constitutes a very important new development in our efforts to understand severe and chronic shyness. Further, it is no accident that today the monoamine oxidase inhibitors ("MAO Inhibitors") constitute the "drug of choice" in the treatment of anxiety/panic attacks—a condition that may well be biochemically and neurologically related to severe shyness. Perhaps the heavy amount of electrical activity in the brains of introverts <i class="calibre4"> causes</i> monoamine oxidase to be produced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or perhaps the monoamine oxidase causes the unusually high electrical activity. There could be a vicious cycle in operation here.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Chapter 3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Societal Reactions and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Elastic Limits</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Inborn temperament constitutes a kind of limit, just as native intelligence represents a kind of limit within which a person must function throughout his/her life. Moralists and many positive mind science devotees delight in continually reminding us that virtually anything is possible—that any person can become anything he/she chooses to become. All he/she needs to do is to set his/her goal clearly in his/her mind's eye (imagination), and commence striving towards it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now up to a point there <i class="calibre4"> is</i> an important element of truth to this positive mind science philosophy. But it is an element that is often misunderstood and not seen in its proper perspective. In order to illustrate this point, let us consider the issue of <i class="calibre4"> learning how to play the piano. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically, almost everyone <i class="calibre4"> could</i> learn how to play the piano at a high level of proficiency. However, research over the years has shown that some people (a rather small minority) are born with the potential for learning how to play the piano rather quickly and easily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Others, on the other hand, remain "all thumbs" at this art over very long periods of time, no matter how long and tirelessly they endeavor to develop the requisite eye-hand coordination and finger dexterity.  <i class="calibre4"> Most</i> <i class="calibre4">people</i> are born with capacities and limits that place them somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">"in between" these two extremes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now all three different kinds of people will have to expend effort and work if they wish to become accomplished pianists. And this includes the Mozarts and the Gershwins who began diddling around the piano keys at age three and with seemingly remarkable success. The key point is that the <i class="calibre4"> amount of time and effort</i> that might have to be expended by <i class="calibre4">some</i> people might be so exceedingly enormous that continuing to work at the piano might logically be deemed a less than productive way for them to spend their time. More succinctly, if these same people found some other type of activity that entails a closer fit to their native talents and potentials, they would far more quickly reap the positive self-feelings 81</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>82 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">that inevitably accrue from noteworthy progress toward worthwhile accomplishments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, learning how to play the piano well may be of such enormous importance to some people that the amount of effort required for attaining mastery is simply not an issue for them. This is fine! For example, Theodore Roosevelt was a weakling as a child; yet he became adept at boxing, hunting, football, as well as at a host of other highly</p>
<p class="calibre1">"masculine" activities. Of course, there is no evidence that Roosevelt had been a <i class="calibre4"> melancholic</i> (figure 1, page 41) child as far as his native temperament had been concerned. We do know that he had been physically weak throughout much of his childhood. But physical weakness is <i class="calibre4"> only</i> <i class="calibre4">sometimes</i> accompanied by high inborn introversion and by a low native anxiety threshold. This is because <i class="calibre4"> physical weakness</i> is a trait that is <i class="calibre4"> statistically independent</i> from inborn melancholia.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the physically weak child is blessed with an advantaged inborn temperament, he will be able to develop his weak body; and he will probably enjoy the process! If, on the other hand, such a weak, physically frail child <i class="calibre4"> also</i> happened to be born high on melancholia, then it is extremely unlikely that he will wish to work to develop his body and to become something which from a psychoemotional standpoint he is not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so we are dealing here with <i class="calibre4"> elastic limits. </i> Like the limits of native intelligence, native temperament does not set hard, fast limits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is always some degree of flexibility to the inborn limits within which all human beings must function and live. For most people with poor native aptitude for learning how to play the piano, it will <i class="calibre4"> normally</i> be more productive for them to find something else to become good at.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their time will be put to far more constructive and efficient use if they do work at something which better fits their native, inborn potentials.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It <i class="calibre4"> is</i> good for all people to learn the desirability of hard work and of the joys and satisfactions that accrue therefrom. But to force a person to work hard at something that is at great variance from his native temperament and inborn potentials is tantamount to causing him to continually beat his head against a brick wall. American culture is enormously rich with thousands of possible activities at which a person can become good or even great. What gain can there be from forcing square pegs into round holes?! What gain can accrue from forcing a person to spend hours working at something for little gain, when that same amount of time and effort in another equally worthwhile pursuit would have netted considerable progress, advancement, and positive self-feelings?</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it is with the little boy who is high on inborn introversion/</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhibition and high on inborn emotionality. If left alone to the ravages of the conventional all-boy peer group he will almost certainly become</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 83</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshy and lonely without the interpersonal skills that are indispensable for effective, happy survival. If, on the other hand, that little boy is introduced to an <i class="calibre4"> alternative</i> peer group composed of little boys <i class="calibre4"> and</i> <i class="calibre4">girls</i> who are reasonably similar to himself in native temperament <i class="calibre4"> and</i> if that little boy is introduced to games and sports that will not frighten him or inspire any sort of bullying, then the chances are exceedingly good that he will be headed for psychoemotional and social adjustment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, as Alexander Thomas has shown, such a little boy's chances for success will actually be about as good as those of children who had been born with more advantaged inborn temperaments.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Wish Bone Effect" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a small figure drawing which I have found to be very helpful in explaining to people the very important concept of <i class="calibre4"> adverse</i> <i class="calibre4">social stimulus value. </i> An adverse social stimulus value is an indispensable precondition for the development of chronic, intractable loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, no one without a negative social stimulus value could ever develop a pathological degree of loveshyness. Mild or transitory, situationally-based shyness is a problem that plagues at least half of the American population from time to time. But the really painful, highly debilitating, lifelong kind of loveshyness which obviates participation in dating, courtship, sexual lovemaking, marriage and family formation, etc., absolutely requires a negative social stimulus value throughout the victim's formative years. And it is this highly debilitating type of loveshyness about which this book is concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Visualize, if you will, a class of one hundred kindergarten boys, all of whom are starting kindergarten together at the age of five and on the same day. The "5" in <i class="calibre4"> Figure 2</i> represents this starting point. Some of these children will come from better, warmer, more competent and loving homes than others will. Similarly, some of them will have had rewarding nursery school experiences, whereas others will not have had this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now every class of children has its "stars". These are the children who exude a very positive social stimulus value right from the very beginning. Occultists might say of such children that they possess very positive, powerful "auras". Generally speaking, the "stars" represent only a comparatively small minority of children. Of our one hundred children we might assume that fifteen are "stars". And we will let the letter <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> represent these fifteen lucky children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as every class of children contains its "stars", every group similarly contains a certain number of children who exude negative social</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a><img src="index-115_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">84 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">FIGURE TWO</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Wish Bone Effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">stimulus value. In the case of our "wish bone effect" drawing, let us assume that the negative social stimulus value is caused by three factors: (1) a melancholic inborn temperament represented by the first quadrant of the Eysenck Cross (figure 1, page 41); (2) low physical attractiveness: these children are not handsome or muscular; and (3) residence with parents who are less than adequately competent at dealing with children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We will further assume that these children possessing negative social stimulus value are all quite normal in the areas of both native intelligence and physical health. In other words, we will assume that their budding problems are not being caused by deficits in the intellectual or physical health areas. Let us allow the letter <i class="calibre4"> "C" </i> to represent these children in the diagram. And let us assume that there are five such children in the total group of one hundred five-year olds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The remaining 80 children are represented in our diagram by the letter <i class="calibre4"> "B". </i> These children are all <i class="calibre4"> "average to somewhat above average" </i> in social stimulus value. And the main point which the diagram illustrates about this majority group is that throughout the formative years of elementary school each of its members makes good, steady progress in the growth and development of interpersonal skills, social self-confidence and social maturity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The numbers running along the bottom of <i class="calibre4"> Figure 2, </i> represent chronological ages. Inasmuch as this is a hypothetical diagram, the ages included range from 5 through <i class="calibre4"> 15. </i> All three lines, each of which commences from the <i class="calibre4"> same point at age</i> 5, are intended to reflect progress in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 85</p>
<p class="calibre1">social/emotional growth, and in level and adequacy of interpersonal skills.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The major point of the "wish bone effect" diagram is that <i class="calibre4"> the rich</i> <i class="calibre4">get richer while the poor get poorer. </i> This cliche is as valid in understanding the development of social self-confidence, interpersonal skills and social/</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotional maturity as it is in understanding the development of financial fortunes. The three lines all start out <i class="calibre4"> at the same point. </i> Yet with each passing year the distance between each of the three lines becomes greater and greater.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, please understand that <i class="calibre4"> line B</i> people are progressing normally. They are growing and progressing at a normal, healthy pace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why the <i class="calibre4"> "B" </i> line moves upward from one chronological age to the next chronological age. The ever increasing amount of distance (1) between <i class="calibre4"> line A</i> and <i class="calibre4"> line B, </i> and (2) between <i class="calibre4"> line B</i> and <i class="calibre4"> line C</i> reflects the fact that relative to the "normal" masses of children, the social stimulus value of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> the "A" children and the "C" children is becoming stronger and stronger with each passing year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The social stimulus value of the "A" children is becoming ever better and better compared to that of the masses. In effect, their "star"</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality continues to improve to the point wherein they appear to be becoming ever brighter and brighter relative to the large bulk of their classmates. The "C" children are similarly becoming increasingly <i class="calibre4"> conspicuous</i> with each passing year. Indeed, the distance between the "C"</p>
<p class="calibre1">children and the "B" children quickly becomes and remains substantially greater than the distance between the "B" children and the "stars" or</p>
<p class="calibre1">"A" children. Let us consider <i class="calibre4"> how this occurs. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason why the "C" boys follow the downward slope from the very beginning is that they withdraw from their fellows' invitations to take part in "rough and tumble" play. They prefer more quiet play at the craft tables with the girls, and they refuse to physically defend themselves when they are punched and bullied. In contrast to the other boys who enthusiastically pursue the "rough and tumble" play and who fight back when they are assaulted, the "C" boys either run away from the irrational boyish hostilities which they cannot understand, or they seek the teacher's protection from this hazing. The more frequently the</p>
<p class="calibre1">'C" boys follow this avoidant course of action, the more conspicuous they become vis-a-vis their classmates. In essence, they develop a reputation as a good person to bully because they don't fight back and because they display their suffering and displeasure in an ever more conspicuous manner. And this serves to compound the bullying and the hazing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist Howard Kaplan has done a good deal of experimental work on aggression. And one of the major conclusions of his many</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>86 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments is that aggression is more likely if the other person (the victim) is perceived as unwilling or unable to retaliate. And this is exactly the position of the "C" children. Physically aggressive retaliation is not in keeping with their native temperaments. They cannot understand the feelings and the motives of the "B" children; and the "B" children cannot understand them (the <i class="calibre4"> "C" </i> children). Being fundamentally serious by nature, the "C" children are not really <i class="calibre4"> "kids"; </i> it is not congruent with their temperaments to "kid around". And this is one of the things that makes adults and virtually all <i class="calibre4"> male</i> "B" children incapable of understanding them (the "C" children).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile these "C" children are gradually learning to run right home immediately after school, and to avoid all informal social activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Being anywhere near peers when a supervising adult is not around to protect them is a potentially very painful and dangerous thing. And so they become isolates. They are discouraged by all different kinds of people from playing with the girls because "boys are not supposed to play with girls". And they cannot play with the boys because the boys are a source of physical pain and danger. And they cannot choose any alternative peer groups, sports and games because there are no sanc-tioned alternatives available. Since boys are not supposed to even want to "play gentle", no gentle sports or games are made available to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the "C" boys grow older their deficits in interpersonal skills become ever greater, thus rendering them more and more adversely conspicuous vis-a-vis their normally adjusted "B" group peers. Again, the children's peer group is an indispensable socializer for interpersonal skills and social self-confidence. In being denied a peer group and in being forced to function all the time as social isolates, the <i class="calibre4"> "C" </i> children are prevented from acquiring interpersonal attributes that are quite crucial for successful adult living. This is why with each passing year they become ever more adversely conspicuous vis-a-vis their peers. And the more adversely conspicuous they become, the more often they are singled out for bullying and/or for ignoring. The "B" children who do not bully simply do not care to have anything to do with the "C" children inasmuch as merely being seen with or around a "C" child could confer a negative reputation. In this sense tolerant and compassionate behavior tends to be punished and stigmatized by the all-boy peer group. Seldom is such positive behavior rewarded by male children here in American society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since all human beings require some sort of attention and recognition, some of the bullied and/or ignored "C" boys may become class clowns. As negative attention is almost always less painful than an absence of attention, some of them can be expected to generate a host</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 87</p>
<p class="calibre1">of increasingly unhealthy defense mechanisms. These clownish behaviors will themselves serve to further alienate the "C" boys more and more from the "B" boys and from the "A" boys. And the more alienated, detached and unidentified with their age-mate peers they become, the more emotionally immature they will be perceived by others as being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, by the time they become teenagers their level of interpersonal skills and social-emotional maturity will be very, very poor by comparison with the normally adjusted "B" and "A" children in their class. And by that time many of them will be perceived as "weird" or</p>
<p class="calibre1">"queer" or "gay" (homosexual).</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the "A" boys the same mechanism operates except in the reverse way. At the outset they are more handsome and muscular than most of the other boys. And this positive social stimulus value thus renders them sought after companions. Even at age 5, everyone wants to play with them because they are attractive and competent, and because they behave (due to inborn temperament) in a sociable and fearless yet friendly, nonpugnacious manner. And since everyone wants to be with them, they gradually develop a strongly positive, robust self-image and social self-confidence. Further, they swiftly come to develop a friendly, positive attitude towards most of their age-mates. They like most of their age-mates because these age-mates almost constantly honor them by selecting them first for games and for a host of other social and recreational activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of this positive attention has its <i class="calibre4"> cumulative impact. </i> These people in the "A" category come to feel so good about themselves that they experience little anxiety in asserting themselves vis-a-vis their peers as well as vis-a-vis the adult community. In essence, their social maturity and interpersonal skills grow and proliferate by leaps and bounds as the years pass. By the time they enter adolescence they are likely to be elected to important class offices, and all the girls consider them "cute"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and want to go out with them. Their social presence by this time has become quite conspicuous in the <i class="calibre4"> positive</i> sense by comparison with that of the normally adjusted "B" children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the inborn social stimulus value created by (1) native temperament, and (2) physical attractiveness, serves to get young boys started on either the right foot or on the wrong foot relative to their peers. As <i class="calibre4">figure 2</i> illustrates, those who commence school at age five with an adverse social stimulus value tend to be avoided, ignored, or bullied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as a consequence such disadvantaged children learn to avoid people; and they learn to associate the very thought of informal socializing with thoughts of mental pain and anguish. As such, their interpersonal skill deficits and their social self-confidence deficits relative to their peers</p>

<p class="calibre1">become worse and worse with each passing year. In addition, their social stimulus value similarly becomes ever worse with each passing year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the essence of how boys become chronically loveshy adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, the shyness itself is learned. But one cannot begin to correctly understand how this learning takes place without understanding and appreciating the fact that the inborn temperament factors represent indispensable catalysts and prerequisites for this negative learning to get under way in the first place. The learning which results in intractable loveshyness could never get started in the first place in the absence of the <i class="calibre4"> twin catalysts</i> of (1) an inborn temperament of adverse social stimulus value, and (2) less than pleasing physical attractiveness/handsomeness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Sociological Perspective</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For readers with some background in sociology it will be apparent that Charles Horton Cooley's <i class="calibre4"> "looking-glass self" </i> theory is highly applicable here. The people in a child's social field represent, metaphorically speaking, a kind of looking-glass or mirror. Human beings are constantly seeing a kind of reflection of themselves in this social looking-glass—in the sorts of feedback reactions (good, bad, and indifferent) that it provides. The problem, of course, is that impressionable minds <i class="calibre4"> internalize</i> the messages that they are constantly in the process of receiving from this social mirror. Parents, teachers and age-mate peers represent <i class="calibre4"> significant others</i>—a salient and highly influential part of the social mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, when the social <i class="calibre4"> mirror</i> feeds back consistently ego disparaging, caustically unkind messages, the sense of self (self-image) rapidly becomes one with those messages. Thus, the child internalizes these consistent messages and becomes intractably welded to an inferiority complex.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Every Group Needs a Deviant</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For many years now sociologists have been arguing that every group of at least five or more persons needs a deviant, and that members will be constantly on the alert for whatever criterion they can find which might permit them to recruit a particular one of their fellows for the deviant status. Seeing the deviant (noncomformist) get punished or ostracized for his behavior tends to enhance the awareness of all group members of the prevailing norms. And it tends to make each group member become more and more mindlessly and uncritically accepting of the "righteousness" of the prevailing norms.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 89</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is certainly true for norms regarding what for male children represents inadequately "masculine" behavior. For example, some thirty years ago social psychologist Muzafer Sherif conducted what has become a classic study of 10-year old boys at a summer camp. Sherif's study dealt with a number of important group processes. And for it he recruited about 100 boys, all of whom were the "cream of the crop" back in their respective communities and elementary schools. Each boy accepted as a research subject was given a free five-week stay in a Connecticut summer camp. Boys were accepted into the study from all over the state of Connecticut. However, in order to be accepted for the study all had to be <i class="calibre4"> leaders, </i> and at the "top of the pecking order" in the respective fifth grade classrooms from which they had just graduated. In essence, all of the boys were highly sociable, "normal", and uninhibited as far as their regular behavior back home had been concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after their arrival at the camp the boys were divided up into twelve-person groups. The boys had all arrived at the camp as strangers. None of them had known any of their fellow campers before their summer camp experience had begun. Yet within just three days of the time the various groups were formed, each group of boys had begun to develop a "pecking order". For the first time in their lives some of the boys were being bullied, teased, and ostracized. One group singled out a boy for the disparaged (deviant) role because of the shape of his head—and they called him "lemon head". Another group singled out a boy because he was not considered fast enough—even though back home that boy had been faster than any of his classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, even when all the members of a particular group are considered "ultra-normal", inside of a comparatively short time span <i class="calibre4">some criterion</i> will be found for creating a pecking order. Especially regarding male children in our highly competitive society, it would appear that not everybody can be "at the top". Many of the boys who had been</p>
<p class="calibre1">"at the top" in both popularity and respect back in their heterogeneous fifth grade classrooms now found themselves at the middle or low end of the totum pole.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sherif's findings have a bearing upon the "wishbone effect". If a deviant can be recruited within three days by a group of boys all of whom had been initially well adjusted and used to being well-respected leaders, it becomes all the easier for us to understand how extremely easy it can be for a group of many different kinds of school boys to recruit an inhibited, isolated classmate for the disparaged, deviant role.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, boys along the "C" line (figure 2; page 41) tend to be highly conspicuous right from the very beginning. And they become ever more conspicuous as time passes—as they are increasingly ignored, bullied, and deprived of a chance to develop interpersonal skills and a socially</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>90 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">confident self-image. The more conspicuous they are, the more intractably crystalized their disparaged, deviant role becomes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Young boys tend to be more insecure than adult men. And in a highly competitive society the more insecure a boys is, the more he will revel in ostracizing and bullying his shy, inhibited classmate. The bully is thus reminded a good deal more often of what the norms are than the better adjusted, more secure boys. The bully is frequently reminded of the norms because he is almost constantly teasing, hazing and bullying the inhibited "deviant" for violating them. The tragedy, of course, is that the inhibited, isolated boy cannot help violating the masculine behavior norms. The inhibited, shy boy is only being true to his native, inborn temperament—and he is being punished for thus being himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mentally Retarded as Analogous to the Shy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Research activity on the mentally retarded can be used as an example of how (1) an <i class="calibre4"> accommodating</i> society facilitates adjustment, and of how (2) a society with rigid norms and ideas often causes the shy—and the mentally retarded—to become lifelong problems to both themselves and to others. Some of the important lessons we have learned include the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. The mentally retarded flourish best when they are permitted to play exclusively with the mentally retarded. When they are forced to play among heterogeneous groups of age-mates who are not mentally retarded they are often bullied and severely hazed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as a consequence they regress by engaging in schizophrenic withdrawal, clownish behavior, or through just plain becoming sick.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. We have learned that the mentally retarded flourish best, as do <i class="calibre4">all</i> human beings, when they are accorded genuine recognition, respect and encouragement for their accomplishments. This is the theory behind the so-called "Special Olympics" wherein the retarded are encouraged to compete with children who are like themselves, and to experience the joy of winning and of the social recognition that accrues therefrom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. We have learned that it is almost always best to encourage the mentally retarded to date and to marry. As is true with almost all human beings, marriage brings the best out of the mentally retarded. Encouraging the mentally retarded to procreate children represents another matter entirely. And very often this cannot be done. But we have learned that through involving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 91</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mentally retarded in meaningful work and love roles (including marriage), they flourish and they contribute maximally to themselves and to society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now I believe that a useful parallel can be drawn between the mentally retarded child and the inhibited, shy child. For some reason American society has long been far more ready and willing to accommodate itself to the needs of the blind child, the mentally retarded child, the deaf mute child, the physically ill or deformed child, etc., than it has been to make reasonable accommodations to the inhibited, shy child, particularly if that child is a boy. The implicit assumption is that being born in the melancholic quadrant (figure 1, page 41) of the Eysenck Cross is a <i class="calibre4"> characterological defect and flaw</i> rather than the trait of <i class="calibre4"> inborn</i> temperament that it <i class="calibre4"> actually</i> is. And the further assumption is that what the boy with inborn melancholia (low anxiety threshold/high inhibition) really needs is <i class="calibre4"> a good, swift kick in the</i> ass!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody ever seriously suggests a "kick in the ass" for the epileptic child, for the deaf mute, for the blind, or for the mentally retarded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, we do not even suggest such a course of action for the child of seemingly normal intelligence who just doesn't seem to be able to learn how to read. No! Instead we devise special classes in remedial reading, and we expend a great deal of both personnel and financial resources in order to enable such children to grow and to flourish on as normal a basis as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We have always assumed that temperament is somehow different from other human traits. And we have become quite moralistic about this quite false assumption. Too many psychologists continue believing that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> behavior and <i class="calibre4"> all</i> elements of personality are <i class="calibre4"> learned</i>—and because they are <i class="calibre4"> all</i> learned they can <i class="calibre4"> all</i> be unlearned if and when the right therapy is provided. These psychologists and the educators and parents who have been influenced by them continue to be strangely oblivious to the hundreds of scholarly papers and books that have been published over the last twenty years on the subject of inborn, biologically based temperament. And they continue to be oblivious to the fact that while certain traits, such as shyness, low self-esteem and neurosis <i class="calibre4"> are</i> learned, they are learned as a direct byproduct of a hostile, punishing attitude that is displayed towards boys who manifest a melancholic inborn temperament.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, in fact, do inhibited boys usually end up as friendless isolates whereas passive, quiet girls almost always end up with at least a few friends along with satisfactory levels of interpersonal skills? The answer must be that the same inborn temperament that is punished with hazing, bullying and ignoring when it is displayed by little boys is accepted with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>92 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">kindly tolerance when it is displayed by little girls. The point is that this hazing, bullying and ignoring has an extremely deleterious <i class="calibre4"> cumulative</i> <i class="calibre4">impact</i> upon a growing child over the course of his formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Jane Elliott Study</p>
<p class="calibre1">A classic study which very clearly illustrates the cumulative impact of wrongful social definitions upon people was conducted in 1968 through 1971, by Jane Elliott. Ms. Elliott was a rather unlikely candidate for the authoring of one of social science's most creative and important studies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She worked as a third grade teacher in the small northeastern Iowa town of Riceville. Up until the time of her experiment she had been a very motherly, highly respected teacher who had been well liked by all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, upon the assination of Dr. Martin Luther King in March 1968, she became very distressed and upset. She wanted to teach her eight and nine year old pupils the evils of racial discrimination, but did not know how to approach the problem in a way that would prove incisive and thoroughly convincing. Eight year olds cannot be lectured to in the way that university students and adults are commonly dealt with in educational settings. And aggravating the problem was the fact that most of her young pupils had never even seen a black person apart from on television or in the movies. The children were all living in a very rural part of a state which has very few black residents. Of our fifty states, only Wyoming has a smaller fraction of black residents than does Iowa.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She finally hit upon a plan which she decided to pursue with enthusiasm and conviction. She entered her classroom one morning with a large book which she claimed had been written by a very famous scientist who is extremely wise and knowledgeable. She proceeded to tell her young pupils that this scientist had determined that brown-eyed people are naturally dirty, unkempt, uncooperative, incapable of learning at a satisfactory speed, incapable of retaining knowledge, discourteous, unlikely to go far in life, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> She proceeded to enumerate quite systematically a whole host of ways whereby brown-eyed people were alleged by the scientist to be inferior to blue-eyed people. And since her class was composed of <i class="calibre4"> nine</i> brown-eyed children and <i class="calibre4"> nine</i> blue-eyed children (and she herself was green-eyed), she had rather fertile soil for her experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, Ms. Elliott had been well-liked, and there was a very strong tendency for these impressionable young minds to believe everything that she said. And as she proceeded through her twenty minute sermon about the evils of brown-eyed people and the virtues of those with blue eyes, she could see the brown-eyed children begin to slouch and to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 93</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel off into a world of daydreams. In fact, throughout the experimental day the disparaged brown-eyed children reacted primarily in one of four different ways—depending upon their individual temperaments: (1) withdrawing and going off into a world of fantasy, daydreams, or sleep; (2) crying and sulking; (3) clowning and goofing off behavior; and (4) hostile, obstreperous, inconsiderate and/or bullying behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, as Ms. Elliott made her way through the same initial spiel, the blue-eyed children began to sit up more and more erect. They began to pay attention to what was going on in class more closely and intensely than many of them had ever done before. In essence, right from the very outset of the experiment the disparaged group (brown-eyed children) and the exalted group (blue-eyed youngsters) began to behave in dramatically and very conspicuously different ways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After Ms. Elliott completed her twenty minute lecture she announced that since brown-eyed children are not likely to go very far in life anyway, and since they do not learn as well as other youngsters, are dirtier, less cooperative, etc., it makes good sense to accord them fewer classroom privileges than the "naturally superior" blue-eyed children should be accorded. And with that she ran down a prepared list of new rules and restrictions that would impact the brown-eyed children from that moment on. And just so that each child in the classroom could tell every other child apart on the basis of the criterion of eye color, she placed large black collars around the necks of each of the brown-eyed youngsters. Once this was accomplished everyone could easily tell whether any particular pupil had brown eyes or blue eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she began to involve the children in their daily reading lesson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As usual each child was required to read aloud a passage from a third grade reader. When a blue-eyed child made a mistake or stumbled through a passage, Ms. Elliott helped him/her along in a kindly manner, and then praised him/her. If a blue-eyed student read a passage well, lavish praise was heaped upon him/her. And she would say: "See, that just goes to show that everything I said is really true. Blue-eyed people really are smarter; and they learn their reading lessons much better than brown-eyed children do."</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, if a brown-eyed child read his/her passage without error, Ms. Elliott rather abruptly asked the child to stop, and she immediately moved on to the next child without according the brown-eyed youngster a word of praise or recognition. If a brown-eyed youngster stumbled through a passage, she reacted with a statement similar to this: "See, that just goes to show how brown-eyed children just won't learn."</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, positive or disparaging remarks were systematically applied to the children throughout the day strictly on the basis of eye color. Positive behavior was ignored in the brown-eyed youngsters,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>94 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">whereas negative behavior was always noticed and punished with a rather coldly phrased comment such as: "I guess this is what can naturally be expected from brown-eyed youngsters."</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the end of the school day quite remarkable changes had occurred in Ms. Elliott's classroom. For example, the brown-eyed third graders had regressed to first grade reading level, whereas the blue-eyed third graders were reading <i class="calibre4"> at or beyond the fifth grade level. </i> Arithmetic scores, vocabulary scores, spelling scores, and all other academic criteria employed to assess change in young children showed that the blue-eyed pupils were all performing (1) far beyond what would normally be expected for third graders, and (2) far beyond where they <i class="calibre4"> (these very</i> <i class="calibre4">same children)</i> had performed just one week prior to the experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These same test scores similarly revealed the brown-eyed children to be functioning at a level that was (1) <i class="calibre4"> far below</i> what would ordinarily be expected for third grade youngsters, and (2) far below the level of performance that they had displayed just one week prior to the experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Academic performance was hardly the only thing to be affected by the experimental design that Ms. Elliott had imposed upon her pupils.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a mere six hours of their new experiences in Ms. Elliott's classroom the brown-eyed children had all suffered serious blows to their self-images. None of these children liked themselves anymore, and they displayed these self-disparaging attitudes in a whole host of ways. Some of the children cried and sulked. Many began to behave in a sullen and disrespectful manner. Several of the nine brown-eyed children spoke of how they didn't want to come to school anymore, and about how they would find ways to play hookey. All began to look increasingly dirty and unkempt. None revealed any interest in learning or in open, friendly socializing with their classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrariwise, by the end of the school day the blue-eyed children had begun behaving far more maturely towards their teacher and vis-a-vis each other than they had ever behaved before. Each child displayed a conspicuously strong enthusiasm for learning and asserted himself/</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself in a friendly, courteous matter, except vis-a-vis their disparaged brown-eyed classmates. And this was as true for children who just one day prior had been the class clowns, the "slow learners", and the all-round "bad boys", as it had been for the blue-eyed children who had always performed well. The posture, grooming, and attitudes towards self that were manifested by these blue-eyed children were nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not necessary to summarize here all of the many interesting facets of Ms. Elliott's experiment. Interested readers will find a good coverage of the study in her book entitled A CLASS DIVIDED which I have listed in the bibliography at the end of this volume. Suffice it to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 95</p>
<p class="calibre1">say that she ran the study on four different third grade classes: 1968</p>
<p class="calibre1">through 1971. And each year she reversed things on the second day of the experiment. In other words, on the second day she advised the children that she had made a mistake, and that it was <i class="calibre4"> really</i> brown-eyed people who are "superior", and that blue-eyed people are actually the inferior ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It should be stressed that Ms. Elliott's findings proved equally strong each time she ran the experiment. Similarly, immediately after she turned the tables she found that the academic performance and the mental attitudes of the blue-eyed children slid downhill in an extremely dramatic and precipitous fashion; whereas the performance and the mental attitudes of the brown-eyed children shot upward quite drastically after only a very short period of time in the exalted role.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Taking Over of a Role</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jane Elliott was interested in demonstrating to her young pupils what it feels like to be a victim of discrimination on the basis of some arbitrarily and capriciously selected criterion such as skin color. She used role playing <i class="calibre4"> (psychodrama)</i> techniques to accomplish this. And, of course, she changed the criterion for discrimination from skin color to eye color.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Both criteria are equally arbitrary inasmuch as a person can choose neither his/her eye color nor his/her skin color.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The point that needs to be stressed here is that blindness, deafness, clubfoot,  <i class="calibre4"> AND INBORN MELANCHOLIA</i> (being born high up in quadrant #1 of the Eysenck Cross depicted in figure #1 on page 41), are all factors that are above and beyond the purview of human choice. People are born with each of these various attributes. And each can be viewed as constituting a "handicap". And just as millions of Americans in past decades had been programmed by their parents through socialization to disparage and discriminate against black people, so it is that many Americans are programmed to disparage and discriminate against melancholic boys—but not melancholic girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The children in Jane Elliott's classroom had only to put up with their second class status for a mere seven hours. But that was enough time for a great deal of damage to be done. Riceville, Iowa, is an isolated, rural community, and Ms. Elliott's pupils had indeed led sheltered lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So perhaps they believed her pro-discrimination rhetoric at the beginning of the school day faster and easier than older, less sheltered children would have believed it. The point, however, is that all young children are to a substantial extent <i class="calibre4"> highly suggestible. </i> And if such enormous changes for the bad or for the good can be effected in children in a mere seven hours, we can begin to appreciate the permanent scars, the lifelong</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>96 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage, which can and most probably will be done to children who cannot escape from this treatment after a mere seven hours of an experimental psychodramatic exercise! Black children who grew up in the Deep South had to live <i class="calibre4"> the entirety of their formative years</i> amidst this sort of arbitrary and capricious discrimination and disparaging treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And melancholic boys (with high inborn introversion/inhibition together with high emotionality) are similarly made to pass through the entirety of <i class="calibre4"> their</i> formative years the victims of this sort of mindless cruelty. It is no wonder that few black children had been able to cultivate a positive attitude towards the American education system—AND TOWARDS</p>
<p class="calibre1">THEMSELVES. And it is similarly no wonder at all that highly introverted, low anxiety threshold males come to think very poorly of themselves. Simply put, disparaged people of all kinds develop negative self-attitudes as well as negative attitudes towards their society as a direct result of the cruel and depersonalized treatment that they are accorded throughout the entirety of their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Ms. Elliott's study an exalted role had been superimposed over the blue-eyed youngsters. They had been defined as having all the virtues, strengths and potentials; and they believed these definitions of the situation. A disparaging role had been superimposed upon the brown-eyed youngsters. And they similarly came to <i class="calibre4"> believe</i> what they had been told about themselves. Many sociologists today call this process the <i class="calibre4"> self-fulfilling prophecy. </i> In short, when we come to define certain things or ideas as real (even when they are actually quite false), those things and ideas tend to become real in their consequences. Perhaps the Bible summarized the same idea in simpler terms: "As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he"; "According to your faith, so be it unto you".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result of Ms. Elliott's <i class="calibre4"> definition of the situation, </i> each child came to embrace a role. And in so doing he/she incorporated a <i class="calibre4"> label</i> into the innermost depths of his/her subconscious mind—which is like a computer memory bank that does not know the difference between what is true and what is false. For some children it was a self-disparaging role (label), and for others it was an exalted role (label). And a great moral dilemma raised by Ms. Elliott's experiment is summarized in the question: "HOW CAN WE ENGINEER A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BRING</p>
<p class="calibre1">: THE VERY BEST OUT OF <i class="calibre4"> EVERY</i> BOY AND GIRL <i class="calibre4"> WITHOUT</i> HAVING</p>
<p class="calibre1">A DISPARAGED GROUP?" In studying Ms. Elliott's experiment most people pay attention <i class="calibre4"> only</i> to what happened to the discriminated against group. But it is <i class="calibre4"> equally important</i> for us to focus upon what happened to the exalted group—to the blue-eyed pupils who had been defined as being intrinsically superior in ability, potential, and in moral and behavioral attributes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 97</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result of having been placed in an exalted role and status, the blue-eyed youngsters began performing better than they had ever performed before. And they enjoyed their school work more thoroughly than they had ever done before as well. Just one day before the experiment had begun, these blue-eyed children had been performing in all ways no differently than the brown-eyed children had been performing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But once they had been given some group of fellows to disparage, to make fun of, to haze and to bully, they started performing better than ever whereas the disparaged victims began behaving worse than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This has a profound bearing upon the issue of children who bully and haze introverted and fearful children. Those who haze are made to feel better about themselves to the extent that they have someone whom they can "put down". Only the most secure human beings are normally able to rise above the temptation to poke fun at others. In essence, emotionally secure, self-loving people do not have any need to hurt others in order to feel good about themselves. What we sorely need in American society right now is a system of education that would promote this inner sense of security and peace in <i class="calibre4"> all</i> children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, each time Ms. Elliott ran her experiment there was always a little boy who refused to go along with the procedure. He refused to accept the benefits and rewards that accrued to those having eyes of the "right" color. And he similarly refused to participate in the bullying and harassing of his less advantaged classmates. Indeed, he often helped out his less advantaged colleagues.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of these noncomformist boys was found to be unusually mature for his age, well adjusted and self-accepting. Each had had the benefit of well educated, highly articulate mothers and fathers who were very emotionally supportive, and who found a great deal of pleasure in reading as opposed to watching television all the time. The parents of these unusually mature and compassionate youngsters were in all cases liberal in their political and social views. And they were significantly <i class="calibre4"> less religious</i> in a conventional sense than most parents in their local community.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Dark Crayons and Drab Drawings</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is another example of the often very serious consequences that befall a child as a result of being enmeshed in a role from which he/she cannot extracate himself/herself. The story concerns a little boy in a fourth grade classroom comprised of about forty pupils. Several times each week all the children were encouraged to draw pictures with the crayons that the teacher provided. And after each picture-drawing session the boy would hand in a drawing that invariably was composed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>98 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">exclusively of dark, drab colors. All of this little boy's drawings were consistently limited to blacks, grays, dark greens, and other very drab shades. And after several months of such drawings the teacher began to become worried. She finally decided to take a large number of the boy's drawings to the school psychologist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days later the psychologist called the child into his office and simply asked him why he drew all these dark, drab pictures. The child's response was that he really didn't have any choice in the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't <i class="calibre4"> want</i> to draw such dreary pictures. But the teacher always started the crayon box at the front of the room. And by the time the crayon box got back to him in the final seat of the rear row, the only crayons left were the blacks, the grays, the dark greens, the browns, and other less than "happy" colors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The moral to this story is that society often creates pathology as a result of the <i class="calibre4"> situations</i> in which it places people. Some situations are especially conducive to pathology whereas others are conducive to health, happiness and adjustment. In essence, boys with high inborn introversion and fearfulness are often required to adapt to situations which simply do not "fit" these native attributes. And because they are forced to remain in these situations they simply do not thrive; and indeed they <i class="calibre4">regress</i> as per the "wishbone effect" discussed earlier. Were society to place these boys in school situations that comfortably <i class="calibre4"> fit</i> their native temperaments, they would no longer be bullied, hazed, harassed or belittled for inborn attributes over which they have no control or choice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they would begin to thrive.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Apperceptive Mass" Concept</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the seventeenth century German philosopher George Herbart introduced a new concept which he called "the apperceptive mass".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Herbart had been trying to explain how human beings get to be the way they are. And his many observations of people led him to become quite dissatisfied with John Locke's idea of the <i class="calibre4"> tableau rasa. </i> Locke had believed that a blank slate (tableau rasa) represented a good metaphor for man's mind at the time of birth. Herbart disliked this metaphor for two primary reasons: (1) you can always erase a slate whereas learning experiences quite frequently tend to remain indelibly and permanently imprinted in the mind; and (2) a slate is a rock, and rocks are hard, rigid and unmale-able. In contrast, the mind of man is in most respects quite pliable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Within limits it can be shaped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This led Herbart to suggest "a glob of clay" as representing a much more accurate metaphor for the way man's mind exists at the time of</p>

<p class="calibre1">his birth. In essence, he suggested that man's mind is like a <i class="calibre4"> shapeless</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">"glob of clay" upon the initial entrance into the incarnate world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, taking this one step further, Herbart began to realize that <i class="calibre4"> nothing</i> is completely "shapeless". Every so-called "shapeless" form has a shape. For example, all clouds have shapes, even though it could accurately be argued that each cloud is actually quite "shapeless". Moreover, "shapeless" forms <i class="calibre4"> vary</i> in their attractiveness—in what could be labeled their <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value. </i> One could take a large number of clouds of similar size; and some of these might be seen as being so beautiful as to cause the conjuring up of romantic images. Others might be seen as being quite ugly or unappealing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose 15,000 twenty ounce globs of clay were laid out on a huge table somewhere. Let us suppose that 15,000 elementary school art students were to be given an outing, and each of them had to select a twenty ounce glob of clay upon which to work. All of these globs of clay are essentially shapeless, and all are of approximately twenty ounces in weight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing one might observe is that some of these globs of clay are preferred over other globs of clay. Indeed, we might expect to observe many of the more aggressive children fighting with one another as to who is going to get to work with the more attractive of the twenty ounce,  <i class="calibre4"> shapeless</i> globs of clay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only do some of the shapeless globs appear superficially to be more or less attractive than its neighbors, but each shapeless glob varies at least a little bit from each other glob in terms of malleability and pliability. Some of the globs of clay might be a slight bit harder in texture than others, and thus may be a little bit more difficult to mold, and less pleasant to the touch. Others, in contrast, may appear to be a modicum too soft. We can assume that the lion's share of these 15,000 globs of clay <i class="calibre4"> can be successfully molded</i> into something attractive and worthwhile—</p>
<p class="calibre1">given the attention of a reasonably dedicated artist-sculptor (parent). A small minority of the globs of clay may not be quite so easy to shape; but <i class="calibre4"> all can</i> be molded into <i class="calibre4"> something, </i> given the right amount of patience, dedication, knowledge and artistic skill.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, each glob of clay (analog of the human mind) can be construed as incorporating both a <i class="calibre4"> passive</i> and an <i class="calibre4"> active</i> component. During a person's formative years the <i class="calibre4"> passive</i> component will always be far more influential than the active component. Hence,  <i class="calibre4"> each perception a</i> <i class="calibre4">person experiences through his/her five physical senses acts to shape and mold</i> <i class="calibre4">(ever so slightly) the glob of clay (mind). </i> The glob of clay (mind) is constantly being shaped and molded because a person can never stop perceiving and experiencing things until the moment of physical death. Thus the molding (experiencing) is <i class="calibre4"> always</i> going on. And it is always going on in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>100 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">a <i class="calibre4"> cumulative</i> manner so that each change builds upon all of those which had preceeded it. Clay can usually be reshaped after clear patterns (a mold) has been established. But it is invariably far easier to set the clay into the right shape and pattern <i class="calibre4"> initially, </i> than it is to destroy an old shape and then try to mold a new one out of the same raw material.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact of the artist's shaping and molding tends to be far more influential during the early stages of the work (childhood) than during the later stages. Hence, the parents establish the basic form (permitted by their clay's characteristics) of their "sculpture" during the formative years of the young child's mind. Adolescent and adult experiences simply serve to sharpen and perfect the sculptured piece into its final shape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the glob of clay is constantly being shaped and molded <i class="calibre4"> and</i> <i class="calibre4">changed</i> with each new experience (with some experiences molding and changing it more deeply than others), the glob of clay is <i class="calibre4"> simultaneously</i> <i class="calibre4">functioning in an active way. </i> Simply put, the <i class="calibre4"> apperceptive mass</i> (mind) "glob of clay"  <i class="calibre4"> is ALSO the thing that is doing the perceiving and interpreting. </i> People</p>
<p class="calibre1">"see" and interpret things with their MINDS, and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> with their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes are merely receptors. Similarly, the ears, smell, taste and touch senses are nothing more than receptors. The sense organs do no interpreting or perceiving on their own. Perceiving and interpreting (which is an integral part of perceiving) can only be accomplished by the <i class="calibre4"> mind</i> (apperceptive mass).</p>
<p class="calibre1">This shaping of the glob of clay (apperceptive mass) by life experience illustrates the fact that as people we are constantly changing. We do not interpret things the same way today as we interpreted them yesterday. During early childhood, changes in the structure and content of the <i class="calibre4"> apperceptive mass</i> (perceiving and interpreting <i class="calibre4"> mind)</i> are often quite dramatic. In a very real sense the three-year old child is in a whole host of ways a <i class="calibre4"> different person</i> than he/she had been at the age of two. Extreme trauma, such as that which might accrue from forcing an inhibited person into wartime combat, might well be expected to drastically alter the <i class="calibre4">apperceptive mass</i> of an adult male and render his interpretive/experiential apparatus enormously altered. But in general, drastic changes over short periods of time are normally limited to the early childhood years. Such drastic changes can occur in perfectly healthy family environments. No trauma need be involved in rendering the five year old a quite different person from whom he had been at age four.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gist of this discussion is that people interpret their world with and through an <i class="calibre4"> apperceptive mass</i> (mind) whose content is constantly changing. Changes become fewer and slower as the organism grows older and matures. But people are nonetheless constantly changing in their perceptions/interpretations of social stimuli. They are constantly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>Societal Reactions and Elastic Limits 101</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the process of change from the moment of birth until the moment of death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, there is both an <i class="calibre4"> active</i> and a <i class="calibre4"> passive</i> component to the apperceptive mass. The apperceptive mass is constantly being shaped and molded, just like a glob of clay. But <i class="calibre4"> at the same time</i> just as the apperceptive mass is being fed more and more <i class="calibre4"> new content</i> with each new experience, it is also functioning in a very active way as <i class="calibre4"> a perceiving</i> <i class="calibre4">and interpreting mechanism. </i> Thus it will see and react to things at least slightly differently today from the way in which it reacted to and perceived them yesterday. This is because its content is constantly in the process of dynamic change. Each new experience (perception) becomes dynamically amalgamated and integrated into the whole of the subconscious mind (computer tape memory/feeling bank).</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Easy children" are perceived by their parents as having attractive <i class="calibre4">(easily malleable)</i> minds ("globs of clay"). They are labeled by their significant adults as being "easy", and they gradually internalize all of the positive intimations that are inherent in this label. The quite total biological and psychoemotional dependency which a very young child feels for its parents virtually assures full, unquestioned, uncritical internalization into the subconscious (robot computer) mind of the mother's labels, regardless of whether these labels might be false or accurate. And in a very important respect these labels serve to enhance the initial characteristics of the seemingly shapeless "glob of clay" (mind), irrespective of whether these inborn characteristics are socially defined as desirable or undesirable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same process applies with regard to so-called "difficult children". Parents perceive certain aspects of their shapeless "glob of clay"</p>
<p class="calibre1">as being socially undesirable. They react to and label these "undesirable"</p>
<p class="calibre1">features. And in so doing they cause these attributes to become accentuated. Thus, the initial inborn traits (regardless of whether they are viewed by the parents as socially favorable or as socially unfavorable) tend to become accentuated and reinforced as a direct consequence of parental labeling. The negative label becomes deeply internalized into the robot computer of the subconscious mind. And initially shy and reserved children thus tend to become more and more shy as time goes by.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the apperceptive mass/"glob of clay" concept of George Herbart provides a useful explanatory "bridge" between the innate, inborn, genetic/biological factors on the one hand, and the learning/</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiential factors on the other hand. The apperceptive mass concept illustrates in a concrete way that there is nothing contradictory or mutually exclusive between <i class="calibre4"> "nature" </i> and <i class="calibre4"> "nurture". </i> They both work together in a synergistic manner to produce the human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>102 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Conclusions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">All human beings are born with a large number of different kinds of limits. The large majority of these limits are to a greater or lesser extent <i class="calibre4"> elastic</i> (not rigid) in nature. All human beings must learn how to function (and adapt) within the confines of their elastic limits. And rendering this task quite difficult in many societies (especially in highly competitive ones) is the fact that the nature and substance of most of these <i class="calibre4"> elastic</i> limits varies enormously from one <i class="calibre4"> male</i> human being to another <i class="calibre4"> male</i> human being. The same, of course, applies to female human beings except that the consequences for deviance are usually milder and much less punitive for females than for males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each elastic limit (human attribute) incorporates a <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus</i> <i class="calibre4">value. </i> Some traits (limits) are viewed as being socially positive whereas others are viewed as being socially undesirable, or neutral. In essence, significant people such as parents, peers and teachers,  <i class="calibre4"> react to and label</i> behavioral traits representing the various elastic limits which belong to an individual. Hence, societal reactions interact in a dynamic, synergistic manner with inborn, biologically based characteristics. The interaction between these societal reactions and biologically based traits <i class="calibre4"> creates</i> in a significant minority of males that consciousness which we call <i class="calibre4"> loveshyness. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, a male who had been born very high on brain monoamine oxidase would be in the context of American society <i class="calibre4"> severely handicapped</i> from the standpoint of societal (especially all-male peer group) reactions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ibid., p. 80).</p>
<p class="calibre1">In America, high brain monoamine oxidase would render a male</p>
<p class="calibre1">"neurotic" rather than "schizophrenic." Today it is widely recognized that schizophrenia and autism are full-fledged <i class="calibre4"> brain diseases, </i> just like multiple sclerosis. As brain diseases they are in no way caused by faulty learning or by bad parenting. They are caused entirely by degenerative biological processes impacting the brain and limbic systems that we are only just beginning to understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the major point of this chapter is that societal reactions act to reinforce, accentuate and enhance inborn characteristics irrespective of whether these inborn characteristics are good or bad.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Astrology and Reincarnation</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Respected scientific research journals are finally beginning to publish papers on the possible causative influence of psychic and occult variables. As of the middle 1980s, no book intending to present a comprehensive overview of the most probable causes of severe loveshyness could afford to ignore such factors. Accordingly, I offer this chapter as a brief summary of the very best of what is known or suspected at this time.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Astrological Factors</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The August 1978, issue of the quite reputable JOURNAL OF SOCIAL</p>
<p class="calibre1">PSYCHOLOGY contained an especially thought-provoking research paper on the influence upon native temperament of astrological sun signs. James Mayo, the author of this study, had been a graduate student of Hans Eysenck at the University of London. Like most scientific scholars, Eysenck had long considered astrology as being in the category of myth and nonsense. However, one day Mayo pointed out to him that a crucial astrological hypothesis could be tested at virtually no cost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, Eysenck had available a computer tape which contained a very great deal of research data including (1) the introversion-extroversion scores, and (2) the birth dates, for 2,324 University of London students. In addition, (3) native emotionality scores were also available for all of these students. Eysenck was about to use all of these data for research purposes that had nothing to do with astrology. However, his student, James Mayo, succeeded in convincing Eysenck of the prudence of checking out certain astrology-based hypotheses "while he was at it". Again, he might just as well test these astrological hypotheses inasmuch as it would not cost any additional time, money or trouble to do so. All the necessary data were already there!</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have stressed, introversion-extroversion is one of the factors of native temperament that is most strongly related to loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chronically loveshy men tend to be unusually introverted and inhibited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">103</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>1 0 4 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the past 6,000 years, astrological theory has contended that people born under <i class="calibre4"> even</i> numbered sun signs (i.e., Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces) are likely to be significantly more introverted and inhibited in their approach to life than people born under the odd numbered sun signs of Aires, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. And much to the astonishment of both Mayo and Eysenck, this is exactly what was found for the 2,324 students studied. It was further found that Taurus, Pisces, Capricorn, and Scorpio <i class="calibre4"> males</i> (in that order) were the most introverted people of all. On the other hand, Sagittarius and Aires people (regardless of sex) were found to be the most extroverted and outgoing of all people. Simply put, these findings are exactly in accord with what astrological theory has long predicted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, for thousands of years <i class="calibre4"> water sign</i> people (i.e., Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces) have been believed by astrologers to be highest on emotionality. And with one exception, this is exactly what Mayo found.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Only four</i> of the twelve sun signs scored above the mean on emotionality; and in order of strength of emotionality these were: Pisces, Aires, Cancer, and Scorpio. Of these four, only Aires was "out of place". Aires is not a water sign.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It needs to be stressed, of course, that the sun sign represents <i class="calibre4"> only</i> <i class="calibre4">one</i> small element of a person's natal chart (horoscope). In fact, many astrologers consider the ascendant or <i class="calibre4"> "rising sign" </i> to be of at least equal importance as the sun sign. And many other practicing astrologers believe the moon sign to be almost as crucial to accurately understanding a person as the sun and ascendant signs. (The ascendant sign is the constellation of stars that is on the horizon at the moment of a person's birth.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">For most contemporary astrologers each human being has twelve signs: one for each of the <i class="calibre4"> eight planets</i> (not counting the Earth), the sun, the moon, the <i class="calibre4"> ascendant constellation</i> (rising sign), and the <i class="calibre4"> midheaven constellation. </i> Thus a professional astrologer looks at where in the heavens each one of these twelve items had been located at the moment of a person's birth. Apart from the rising sign and the midheaven, the other ten items for any given person could have been located anywhere within the 360 degree circle representing the heavens. For convenience astrologers divide the 360 degree circle representing the heavens into twelve equal slices that are known as <i class="calibre4"> houses. </i> And each one of these twelve <i class="calibre4">houses</i> entails implications for a different aspect of human life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A person's natal chart (horoscope) is nearly unique. It would require in excess of 25,000 years before another person could be born with the exact same horoscope as you, the reader. Contrary to widespread popular impression, almost all contemporary astrologers <i class="calibre4"> reject</i> the notion that the sun, planets, and constellations of stars,  <i class="calibre4"> cause</i> differences in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Astrology and Reincarnation 105</p>
<p class="calibre1">human behavior or personality. To be sure, the position and fullness of the sun and moon (because of their close proximity to the Earth) may have some temporary effects upon behavior just as they do upon the tides. But the essential core of astrological causation lies in the concept of <i class="calibre4"> synchronicity, </i> a term originally coined by the late, great psychoanalyst Carl Jung, who at the beginning of his career had been one of Freud's major disciples.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">How Astrology Is Believed to Work</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put,  <i class="calibre4"> synchronicity</i> means that at the time of a person's birth there is a unique <i class="calibre4"> alignment of nature</i> in the heavens, and that this alignment of nature, signified by the exact position of all of the planets, sun, moon and stars, closely correlates (1) with the constellation of lessons the person must learn in this particular incarnation and "classroom of life", and (2) with the person's behavioral predispositions, inborn temperament, intelligence, aptitudes, attractiveness, adaptive capacity, and potential problem areas. According to this viewpoint astrology imposes a uniquely different set of <i class="calibre4"> elastic limits</i> upon each person. And through studying his or her natal chart a person can arrive at a better understanding of what these elastic limits are and of what his or her life purposes are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Astrology is <i class="calibre4"> NOT deterministic</i> in that each person is believed by astrologers to be fully capable of exercising free will and self-determination up to the boundaries of his/her elastic limits. Of course, elastic bands <i class="calibre4">break</i> when they are pushed beyond their limits. And like elastic bands, each person has his/her own unique set of limits. Nevertheless, each person <i class="calibre4"> chooses</i> what he/she <i class="calibre4"> does</i> and <i class="calibre4"> does not</i> do with each problem area or opportunity that arises in his/her life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More specifically, the alignment of nature (in the heavens) at a person's birth is believed to constitute a direct reflection of that person's <i class="calibre4">karma</i> for this specific incarnation. In essence, life is comprised of an unlimited series of classrooms of learning. For each and every soul, some of these classrooms exist on this (the mortal) side of the veil. And some (probably many more) exist on the "other side" of the veil on innumerable etherial levels at the higher planes of vibration. The ratio of positive to negative (and/or neutral) learning experiences which a person must undergo during any given incarnation or discarnation is simply a reflection of the karma which he or she had worked up in his/her former incarnations and discarnations. The soul chooses the time, place, parents, and the circumstances of its own birth for the lessons it must learn and for the progress it wishes to make during the course of the appointed incarnation. Hence, the model posited by most contemporary astrologers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>106 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">for explaining loveshyness might look something like that which is indicated in <i class="calibre4"> Figure 3. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence,  <i class="calibre4"> karma</i> is the <i class="calibre4"> first cause; </i> and the synchronistic operation of astrology is nothing more than a manifestation of this first cause ("karmic law"). Thus karma, with astrology as its <i class="calibre4"> overt</i> and analyzable byproduct, gives rise to the <i class="calibre4"> genes</i> and to the <i class="calibre4"> congenital problems/advantages</i> (such as malfunctioning or well functioning enzymes and hormones), which in turn give rise to such key factors as native temperament, attractiveness of appearance, intelligence, gender, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> These key factors all entail a good, bad, or indifferent social stimulus value. People respond to them in negative or in positive ways. Chronic loveshyness or its polar opposite is thus created. More succinctly, it is created as a byproduct of the person's underlying karma—the <i class="calibre4"> first</i> cause.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karma is believed by Spiritualists and by astrologers to follow the immutable laws of the universe which are contained within the universal cosmic intelligence or "universal God-mind" which, in turn, is contained within everything animate and inanimate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus astrological theory does not contradict or disagree with the principles of social learning and of behavior modification. Instead it fills out the picture. Some people are born with a passive, withdrawn inborn temperament and/or they are born into a social group that does not react favorably to passivity and/or to the newly incarnated soul (child) in his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her physical body. Rejection by others combined with an unusually sensitive inborn temperament doubtless leads to a low self-esteem as far as functioning in purely sociable, social situations is concerned which, in turn, leads to intractable loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Present Research</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When I first began the data collecting for the research upon which this book is based, I had every intention of studying astrological factors in a very comprehensive way. Unfortunately, most of the loveshy men studied did not know their exact birth times. In order for astrological hypotheses to have been correctly tested, I as researcher would have had to have had access to each respondent's birth time within an accuracy range <i class="calibre4"> of five minutes. </i> Since it was not feasible to obtain this information, I had to make do with mere birth date data alone as far as most of the respondents were concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Briefly stated, my own analysis corroborated that of Mayo. Hence, significantly more of my chronic loveshys had sun signs of Taurus, Pisces, and Capricorn, than would have been expected by chance. Similarly, the self-confident non-shys I studied had many more Sagittarians</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><img src="index-138_1.png" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Astrology and Reincarnation  1 0 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>108 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Aires people among them than would have been expected by chance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the following generalizations also appear warrented: 1. Loveshy men have a surfeit of planets located in the 4th, 5th, and 6th houses. This is interesting because in astrology this signals low self-sufficiency combined with high introversion/</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhibition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. The chronically loveshy are significantly more likely than self-confident men to have their natal Saturn in the 5th or 7th houses. This is interesting because in astrology Saturn is the planet of restrictions. It is often referred to as the "negative teacher". The 7th house is the house of marriage and partner-ships; the 5th house is the house of sex and of children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Chronically loveshy men have an overrepresentation of Mars in Cancer and in Pisces. In astrology Mars is the planet of <i class="calibre4"> energy</i> <i class="calibre4">and drive. </i> Cancer and Pisces are regarded as the two worst signs for Mars because they are associated with inertia and with energy wastage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Loveshy men tend to have significantly more fixed signs and earth signs in their horoscopes than do self-confident, non-shy men. In astrology such combinations would be associated with inhibition and with stubborn and often intractable problems such as loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Loveshy men are quite likely to have a natal Saturn that is square or conjunct to the natal sun or natal moon. Many loveshys have Saturn in the same sign as either their sun, moon, or ascendant.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Severely loveshy men are significantly more likely than non-shys to have their natal Mars in one of the following four houses: 7th, 6th, 4th, and 3rd, in that order. Severe loveshyness seems to be associated with the natal Mars being <i class="calibre4"> opposite</i> either the native's ascendant or the native's midheaven—give or take an orb of ten degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">7. Severely loveshy men show some tendency for their natal Neptunes to be at or near their midheavens. Neptune is the planet of fantasy, daydreams and illusion. Those with Neptune at or near the midheaven are believed by astrologers to be dominated (ruled) by fantasy and illusion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">8. Severely loveshy men show some preponderance of planets, sun, moon, ascendant, and midheaven, in signs ruled by Venus: i.e., Taurus and Libra. Many loveshy men have at least <i class="calibre4"> two</i> of the three major astrological elements (sun, ascendant, and moon) in the Venus-ruled Taurus and Libra.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Astrology and Reincarnation 109</p>
<p class="calibre1">9. Down through the centuries it has been noticed that the severely loveshy <i class="calibre4"> (men</i> in particular) are substantially more likely than the nonafflicted to have been born during the <i class="calibre4"> May 16 to 19</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">period than during any other four-day period of the calendar year. The star called <i class="calibre4"> Caput Algol</i> rules this four-day period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditionally this star had been called "The Evil One". And the evidence collected from scores of astrologers (including contemporary ones) indicates that this star does appear to have a detrimental impact upon a person's powers of endurance. Men, in particular, who had been born during this four-day period are highly likely to be <i class="calibre4"> excessively passive. </i> Further, the <i class="calibre4"> Caput Algol</i> personality is commonly perceived as being "pleasant but noncompetitive" and sort of unambitious.</p>
<p class="calibre1">10. Astrologers determine a person's sign for twelve different items: the sun, the moon, the rising sign, the midheaven, the two inner planets, and the six outer planets. Each of these twelve items had been in some astrological sign at the moment of a person's birth. The severely loveshy are much more likely than the nonafflicted to have been born with <i class="calibre4"> nine or more</i> of these twelve items in <i class="calibre4"> "negative" </i> or <i class="calibre4"> "feminine" </i> signs: i.e., Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">11. Those born with Jupiter and Saturn <i class="calibre4"> conjunct</i> (give or take an orb of ten degrees) have an above average vulnerability towards becoming severely loveshy. This is especially true if the conjunction occurs in the 5th or 7th houses.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually <i class="calibre4"> we will know for sure</i> whether these and other possible astrological factors correlate with severe loveshyness. If there is a real and significant association between any of these factors and the tendency to develop severe loveshyness, the astrological natal chart will provide society (including medical and education functionaries) with a conspicuous clue from the very beginning as to just exactly which children may be at risk of developing pathological degrees of loveshyness. The astrological natal chart is set at the precise moment a person is officially born into this incarnate world. Therefore, if it should turn out that there is anything really worthwhile to astrology as a diagnostic and predictive tool, it will eventually prove extremely advantageous as such a tool in helping towards the propitious engineering of home and school environments for the loveshy prone. This will serve to effectively block loveshyness symptomology from developing in the first place, as well as all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>110 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the other social and psychological factors which are known to be causal antecedents for the development of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reincarnation</p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1977 the prestigious and esteemed medical JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE published two research articles on the subject of reincarnation. Both were written by Dr. Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia School of Medicine. (See especially his article titled: "The Explanatory Value of the Idea of Reincarnation".) For the past three decades Dr. Stevenson has traveled all over the world studying cases of young children between the ages of two and six, who possess vivid memories of former incarnations. These memories often incorporate an ability to speak a language which had not been learned <i class="calibre4"> (or even heard)</i> during the current life. This phenomenon is known as <i class="calibre4"> xenoglossey. </i> And it is not at all unusual for such children to name names, dates, places, etc., which can be and often are checked out and verified by research teams such as the one headed by Ian Stevenson. In some of the most dramatic cases a three or four year old child will have lucid memories of his wife, sons and daughters in a previous life. Indeed, such children have been known to discuss the most intimate details of their sexual lives vis-a-vis their spouses of a past incarnation. And they articulate their ideas quite fluently and in adult vocabulary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are essentially two major methods of studying reincarnation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first of these is the technique employed by Dr. Stevenson. This involves studying young children with vivid and detailed memories of former lives. The second approach is known as hypnotic age regression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And it involves placing a person into a deep trance and hypnotically regressing him/her back prior to his/her current lifetime. Hypnotic age regression is quite a bit more popular than the first approach because (1) it is far less expensive, and (2) it is easier to accomplish provided that the services of a skilled hypnotist are enlisted. As with the Stevenson approach, detailed data complete with names, dates, places, etc., often surface. Such data can be and very often are checked out and verified empirically. People often commence speaking in a foreign language once they are under a deep trance. Of course, the remarkable thing is that these languages and other information had never been learned by the person in his or her current lifetime.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So extensive is the use of age regression hypnosis today that some of its practitioners have devised a new school of psychotherapy that has come to be known as <i class="calibre4"> past lives therapy. </i> Since 1976, several books have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>Astrology and Reincarnation  1 1 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">been published on this approach to psychotherapy, and these include at least a half-dozen that had been written primarily with the lay person in mind. (See especially the works of Netherton, Wambach, and Sutphen, all of which are listed in the bibliography.) The essential idea behind "past lives therapy" is that pathological, highly debilitating phobias, fears, and other hang-ups are often the result of traumas that had taken place during former incarnations. Therapy proceeds by gradually bringing the patient back to the traumatic event and having him/her <i class="calibre4"> relive</i> it through the hypnotic process. In other words, just as the conventional psychoanalyst tries to get his/her client to experience a catharsis and a highly emotional abreaction of a traumatic event of his/her <i class="calibre4"> current</i> life, past lives therapy strives toward this same goal <i class="calibre4">via hypnosis</i> with regard to <i class="calibre4"> a past life</i> or lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We do not know why. But past lives psychotherapists have allegedly achieved a far more impressive "cure rate" than have conventional psychoanalysts. (Again, see the writings of Netherton, Wambach, and Sutphen.) Personally, I do not believe that <i class="calibre4"> "insight" </i> or an emotionally charged</p>
<p class="calibre1">"reliving" of a traumatic event (irrespective of whether that event had occurred during the present lifetime or during a past one) could ever prove sufficient to help the severely loveshy man out of his plight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, a full awareness of the ultimate source of one's problem can never hurt and indeed may even help—at least a little bit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now Netherton, Wambach and Sutphen have not worked with any severely loveshy men. They have worked primarily with female clients who had been phobic or severely anxiety-prone at the time they had been treated. Of course, this does not render their highly impressive and most heartening results any less meaningful or any less important.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is certainly to be hoped that their techniques will soon be tried on the severely loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Implications</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The highly detailed memories of past lives which Dr. Stevenson found among certain two-to-six year old children are not very commonplace. But cases do crop up from time to time all over the world, including right here in the United States and Canada. However, when such memories become conspicuously manifest in the life of a child such significant others as parents, peers and teachers feel quite "unnerved" about it and frequently take steps (often punitive in nature) to discourage the phenomena. This is why almost all children forget such memories by the time they reach the age of six. Children become so involved in the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>112 THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitements and demands of their current existence that their memories of the past tend to become lost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it is with people who discover detailed memories of a past life or lives through hypnotic age regression. Mrs. Ruth Simmons, the quite conventional housewife of Pueblo, Colorado, who had been permitted through hypnosis to recall vivid memories of her former life as Bridey Murphy in 18th century Cork, Ireland, found herself becoming increasingly upset by these memories—particularly because of the tremendous amount of unwanted publicity which they attracted. Like hundreds of other people, Mrs. Simmons chose to terminate her experiences with age-regression hypnosis because the publicity combined with the highly detailed memories that she had been recalling were causing her current life to become increasingly uncomfortable. Nevertheless, many of her quite detailed memories called up specific facts which were subsequently verified by research teams who went to Ireland in order to analyze what they could of 18th century Cork.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that all serious research work on reincarnation entails clear implications for the study of loveshyness. It is true that comparatively few of us ever manage to remember anything of our past lives. But reincarnational memories may impact upon all people in far more <i class="calibre4"> subtle</i> ways. In essence,  <i class="calibre4"> some</i> of our behavior may be affected by figments of memory of which we are <i class="calibre4"> not consciously aware, </i> and which we do not think of as being associated with or indicative of past incarnations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A good analogy here would be the way in which conventional</p>
<p class="calibre1">"ESP" operates. We know that all people have extra-sensory perception to <i class="calibre4"> some</i> extent. Very few people have it to a powerful extent; and most of those who do have it to a powerful extent enjoy this benefit for only a comparatively brief portion of their lives—much as the children in Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stevenson's work managed to sustain their strong reincarnational memories only until about the age of six. Psychic healing ability works the same way. All of us have <i class="calibre4"> some</i> psychic healing ability. But a miniscule proportion of people command very powerful and amazing abilities along these lines. The ability of most people for serving as a channel for healing energies is quite limited. And some people have even been found to be "negative healers"—sort of like the "brown thumb" person around plants. These "negative healers" unintentionally sap energy away from the sick and make them worse!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen Wambach of John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, California, has age-regressed thousands of quite ordinary people. And she has found that virtually everyone appears to have at least some past life memories of which they had been entirely unaware and which could be recaptured. Together with Morris Netherton and Dick Sutphen, Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wambach has been able to show that these memories often impact upon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>Astrology and Reincarnation 113</p>
<p class="calibre1">predilections, interests, long-term traits of temperament, fears, career patterns, esthetic and romantic love predilections, etc., in ways that the person had never had any awareness of at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, as with "ESP" and psychic healing, very few people recall vivid thoughts and feelings or traumatic events from past lives. However, virtually everyone tested by Wambach recalled <i class="calibre4"> something. </i> And those with serious psychoemotional adjustment problems often recalled a rich supply of memories when they were hypnotically age-regressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the reliving of these memories, many people have allegedly had their present adjustment problems quite fully remedied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, if reincarnation impacts at all on human beings its influence is not likely to be limited to people such as Ruth Simmons or to four-year old children who vividly recall a life as someone's father or mother in another time and place. Such memories need not be a manifest part of everyday consciousness in order to wield an impact upon peoples'</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives. Conventional empirical scientists have forgotten that man is part spirit and not all physical brain and body. If the spirit mind is indeed immortal, then subtle facets of its past experiences during former incarnations may well impact in significant and long neglected ways upon the development in the current life of such pesky problems as severe loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Psychodormia</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past twenty years a great deal of work has been done at leading universities on the subject of Kirlian photography. Kirlian photography is a form of electromagnetic photography which is capable of capturing on film a likeness of the electromagnetic energy body ("aura") which suffuses the human body as well as all other living things.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past few years a number of psychologists have begun using Kirlian photography as a diagnostic device. For example, New York City clinical psychologist Lee Steiner has found marked differences between the Kirlian auras of socially self-confident people and those of individuals who are inhibited and shy. Happy, self-confident people have auras which are vibrant and brilliantly pulsating with a full and steady glow of strong, white light. Shy and inhibited people, on the other hand, tend to have weak and uneven auras. Dr. Steiner has labeled this latter pattern as <i class="calibre4"> "psychodormia". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous types of people have auras which display the psychodormia pattern. Patients with hypoglycemia, iron deficiency anemia, neurotic difficulties, excessive tiredness due to overwork or insufficient sleep, as well as shyness and inhibition, all tend to exude the very weak</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>114</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF LOVESHYNESS</p>
<p class="calibre1">and uneven Kirlian aura that is indicative of psychodormia. The important point for our purposes, however, is that the Kirlian aura gradually becomes fuller and stronger to the extent that a prescribed, comprehensive therapeutic regimen is followed and the undesirable symptoms begin to dissipate. In other words, once a person is cured of psychodormia, his/her Kirlian aura manifests itself in a full, rich glow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the condition of a person's aura (etheric or energy body) appears to be highly associated with shyness and inhibition. A person's life situation can affect his/her aura. And auric health can and does substantially influence the nature and progress of a person's life.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">How The Information</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Was Obtained</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this chapter is two-fold: (1) to provide a comprehensive summary of the major personal characteristics of the loveshy and the non-shy samples; and (2) to provide a clear and understandable statement as to how the research data obtained for this book were obtained. In a book of this nature there is nothing to be gained by an elaborate discussion of statistical and methodological issues or procedures. However, the reader should have an accurate awareness of the nature of the people studied. Such an awareness will render my discussion of the research results far more interesting and meaningful than it otherwise would be.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Who Is "LoveShy"? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the outset it is important for the reader to have a clear understanding of the nature of loveshyness and of the key characteristics shared by all the people studied for this research. In essence, a loveshy person is one who possesses <i class="calibre4"> each and every one</i> of the following seven characteristics:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) He is a <i class="calibre4"> virgin; </i> in other words, he has never had sexual intercourse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) He is a person who very rarely goes out socially with women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the loveshys studied for this book had dated more than four times during the year prior to being interviewed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) He is a person without a past history of any emotionally close, meaningful relationships of a romantic and/or sexual nature with any member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) He is a person who has suffered and is continuing to suffer emotionally because of a lack of meaningful female companionship. In short, he is a person <i class="calibre4"> who desperately wishes</i> to have 117</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>118 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">a relationship with a woman, but does not have one because of shyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(5) He is a man who becomes extremely anxiety-ridden over so much as the mere thought of asserting himself vis-a-vis a woman in a casual, friendly way. This is the essence of "loveshyness".</p>
<p class="calibre1">(6) He is a man who is <i class="calibre4"> strictly heterosexual</i> in his romantic and erotic orientations. In other words, he is a person who is <i class="calibre4"> in no way</i> a homosexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(7) He is <i class="calibre4"> male. </i> No female loveshys were studied for this research.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Why Study Men Only? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In regard to point #7, it is recognized that shyness afflicts women in about the same ratio and proportion as it affects men. However, it is also recognized that loveshyness is a far more deleterious condition in the male than it is in the female. In American society it is the <i class="calibre4"> male</i> who is required to make the first move when it comes to the initiating of romantic relationships. This remains a hard, fast, absolute requirement of the male gender that has not been reduced or mitigated in any way by the social changes that have been instigated by the women's liberation movement. To be sure, contemporary norms do permit a woman to initiate contact with a man <i class="calibre4"> after</i> a relationship has already commenced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the norms do not permit a woman to make the first or initial contact with a man; nor do they enable a woman to feel comfortable about the idea of initiating sexual lovemaking with a man <i class="calibre4"> even after</i> a love relationship has gotten started.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result of these norms, chronic loveshyness entails far deeper and more thoroughgoing consequences for the life of an afflicted male than it does for the life of an afflicted female. For example, most loveshy women manage to successfully pass through the various stages of dating and courtship; and they manage to do this at the normal ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the very shy young woman is <i class="calibre4"> no less likely</i> to date and to marry than is the self-confident, non-shy woman. Moreover, unless she is well below average in "looks" there is evidence that she is no more likely than the typical self-confident woman to suffer deprivation of male companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, even very shy women marry. Loveshy men cannot and do not marry irrespective of how strong their desires might be to contract a marriage. Inasmuch as loveshyness blocks and impedes men from living a normal life <i class="calibre4"> and does not do this for women, </i> it is clear that loveshyness is a far more momentous problem for males than it is for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 119</p>
<p class="calibre1">females. Study after study have presented irrefutable evidence to the effect that <i class="calibre4"> men need women a very great deal more than women need men. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Women who for any reason remain in the single, never married category almost always manage to make an emotionally healthy adjustment. In fact, several research investigators have found spinsters to be a happier, better adjusted lot than married women! In stark contrast, the single, never married man has been found to be far more vulnerable than the married man (and the spinster) to a wide range of physical health and social adjustment problems—to say nothing of psychoemotional problems!</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key reason for my choosing to limit my research to the problem of shyness in males is the fact that male shyness is a great deal more likely than female shyness to be associated with <i class="calibre4"> neuroticism. </i> In essence, shy women are not any more likely than non-shy women to be neurotic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast, shy men are a very great deal more likely than non-shy men to be quite seriously neurotic.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most single, never married men are a burden both to themselves and to society, whereas most single, never married women are not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Desperately wishing to marry but being incapable of doing so because of shyness renders the situation of the loveshy male all the more problematic and deserving of serious study. More succinctly, it is only through understanding the plight of the heterosexual man who is "single, never married"  <i class="calibre4"> against his most deeply felt wishes and desires</i> that we will be able to offer and provide constructive help.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Felt Deprivation" Concept</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't believe that anyone can be correctly classified as <i class="calibre4"> "loveshy" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">unless he truly craves emotionally meaningful <i class="calibre4"> female</i> companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Deprivation is never enough by itself to cause mental anguish, pain and suffering. A person cannot <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> deprived of something <i class="calibre4"> unless and until</i> he actually wants the thing of which he is being deprived. A person who truly <i class="calibre4"> feels</i> deprived of something he very dearly wants will necessarily suffer a very great deal (1) from anxiety, and (2) from very painful and highly distracting feelings of preoccupation. He will not be able to concentrate effectively on his work or, if he is a student, on his studies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He will very likely be an underachiever because his intensely painful feelings of deprivation impede him from directing his energies towards constructive ends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If the deprived person is accorded an opportunity to work towards the thing he so strongly desires, his energy-wasting preoccupation and distractability will rapidly dissipate. However, the loveshy man cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>120 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">do this. The loveshy man is prevented from working towards his female companionship goal by his intractable shyness and inhibition, and by the inordinately strong fears of interpersonal anxiety that accompany loveshyness and which are intrinsic to it. Simply put, the mere thought of asserting himself in a friendly way vis-a-vis a girl whom he finds attractive fills a loveshy man with overwhelmingly painful (and forbidding) anxiety feelings. Hence, he can only continue to feel preoccupied and painfully distracted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Criterion #4 for determining who is and who is not loveshy is of crucial and indispensable importance to the research upon which this book is based. Without such a criterion there would inevitably be a good many men getting into the sample who are not personally bothered very much by the fact that they do not have any loving female companionship in their lives. It is important to realize that human beings differ in the extent of their needs for female companionship and for love. A person who is deprived <i class="calibre4"> but who does not feel deprived</i> cannot be a problem either to himself or to his society or community. In short, deprivation on an <i class="calibre4">objective</i> level is not the thing to look for in understanding loveshyness and the many problems to which it gives rise. It is how a person feels on a <i class="calibre4"> subjective</i> level that <i class="calibre4"> really</i> matters. And this is why I made sure that no one got into the loveshy samples unless they very deeply and strongly desired the emotionally meaningful companionship of a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, the problem of loveshyness can be deemed to exist in a man only when that man: (1) deeply and sincerely craves the love and companionship of a woman, and (2) when the mere thought of asserting himself in a friendly way vis-a-vis a woman he finds attractive fills him with extremely painful anxiety feelings. Of course, inasmuch as this study was to concern itself strictly with loveshyness among <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> males, criteria had to be established which would accurately differentiate heterosexual research respondents from those who might be homosexual. It is to this important matter that we now turn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Distinguishing Heterosexuals from Homosexuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for my research to make any sense at all I had to be certain that my samples of loveshy men did not include any homosexuals among their ranks. This is an important issue because young men who are heterosexually inactive and who do not participate in conventional courtship activities are often viewed as being homosexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today most social scientists are in agreement that the following <i class="calibre4">four</i> criteria accurately distinguish heterosexuals from homosexuals:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 121</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) In order for a person to be considered a heterosexual he must agree that throughout his life his romantic infatuations (romantic fantasies and daydreams) had always been directed towards people of the opposite sex rather than towards people of his own sex. Even during the earliest years of elementary school, homosexuals tend to have romantic daydreams about loving and being loved by attractive male classmates. In contrast, heterosexuals have romantic fantasies about pretty girl classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) Heterosexuals always fantasy being with a female partner,  <i class="calibre4"> never</i> a male partner, whenever they masturbate. In contrast, the homosexual always fantasies being with a male partner whenever he masturbates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) In order for a person to be a heterosexual he must <i class="calibre4"> very strongly</i> <i class="calibre4">prefer</i> the idea of having sexual intercourse with a woman to the idea of having sex with a man. (All of the loveshys studied for this book were virgins; none had ever been to bed with anyone of <i class="calibre4"> either</i> gender.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) In order for a person to be a true heterosexual he must define himself <i class="calibre4"> (self-image)</i> as a heterosexual, and not as a homosexual or bisexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Early in each interview questions were asked that were of pertinence to each one of the four foregoing points. If a respondent displayed any ambivalence with respect to any of the four issues the interview was terminated. In other words, respondents whose heterosexuality was in doubt were simply not used.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interestingly, 94 percent of the loveshy men who were interviewed for this study turned out to be strong believers in homosexual rights.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet at the same time every single man interviewed for this study indicated disgust at the mere thought of kissing or making love to another man. In this regard criterion #3 was a good deal more than satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These loveshy men did not merely "prefer" the idea of making love to a woman over the idea of making love to a man. Loving and romancing a beautiful woman was the only thing many of these deprived men ever seemed to think about in their almost incessant fantasies and daydreams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the idea of doing these things with another man was something which none of the 300 loveshy men whom I interviewed could even fathom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With regard to points #1 and #2, social scientists have learned in recent years that <i class="calibre4"> romantic</i> interests and fantasies crop up in most people's lives a good deal earlier than do <i class="calibre4"> sexual</i> interests and fantasies. In fact, most Americans commence their strong <i class="calibre4"> romantic</i> interests in members of the opposite sex some time during their elementary school years.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>122 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, these romantic interests and fantasies appear to be very heavily affected by <i class="calibre4"> esthetic</i> considerations, whereas burgeoning sexual interests in males appear to be little affected by esthetics. For example, the nine-year old boy has fantasies about befriending and spending time with the <i class="calibre4"> pretty</i> nine-year-old female classmate: <i class="calibre4"> never</i> the female classmate who is "less than pretty".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Studies of the childhoods of hundreds of homosexuals have revealed that most homosexuals had begun becoming infatuated with the "pretty faces" of certain <i class="calibre4"> boys</i> some time around the ages of ten or eleven. At such early ages sex tends to be pretty well removed from a boy's conscious awareness; this is as true for homosexual boys as it is for heterosexual boys. At such early ages most pre-homosexuals had never even heard of the word "homosexual", and had no idea as to what it meant or that they were displaying interest patterns which placed them in that social category.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An identifying feature of most of the loveshy men studied for this book was that throughout their formative years they neither enjoyed nor fantasized about either being with or playing with members of their own gender. They did not enjoy the "rough and tumble" play style of their fellow boys. And in addition to their distaste for the rougher play of the all-male peer group, a key reason for their wanting to avoid the all-male peer group was the fact that it did not contain "any pretty people".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Heterosexual loveshy males appear to develop a sense of beauty</p>
<p class="calibre1">! significantly earlier in life than do most people of either gender. And this predilection for the enjoying of beauty seems to become <i class="calibre4"> a driving</i> <i class="calibre4">and heavily preoccupying need</i> for many of them. Several of the loveshys told me that even when they were third grade youngsters they could remember not being able to concentrate on what the teacher was talking about because they were off in a world of rewarding bliss wherein they were enjoying the loyal and steadfast companionship of a very pretty little girl who was one grade below them—in the second grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This very early need for the intense companionship of an opposite sexed age-mate is something which scholars have never found to prevail in the backgrounds of male homosexuals. Pre-homosexual little boys very often do become romantically and esthetically fixated upon other pretty little <i class="calibre4"> boys. </i> In essence, the pre-homosexual little boy never chooses a <i class="calibre4"> little girl</i> to daydream and fantasize about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the strongest indicators of male homosexuality is that of being more interested in sex play with boys than with girls: 78 percent of adult homosexuals in one study said that they had felt this way as children, whereas 82 percent of adult heterosexuals said that they had <i class="calibre4">not</i> felt this way as children. In the current study upon which this book</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 123</p>
<p class="calibre1">is based,  <i class="calibre4"> not one</i> loveshy man out of the 300 surveyed had had any preference at all during childhood for sex play with boys over sex play with girls. Furthermore, not a single one of the 300 loveshys had had any <i class="calibre4"> actual</i> sex play experience during childhood or adolescence with a member of <i class="calibre4"> either</i> gender. As children many of the men I interviewed had <i class="calibre4"> wanted</i> to enjoy sex play with a girl. But not surprisingly they simply did not have the nerve to pull it off—or, for that matter, even to attempt pulling it off!</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short,  <i class="calibre4"> social withdrawal</i> appears to have long been the key earmark of the loveshy. Even though the loveshy are quite clearly heterosexual in their preferences and orientations, they engage in significantly less of BOTH heterosexual AND homosexual sex play during childhood and adolescence than do the non-shy. Interestingly, fully 23 percent of the 200 <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> heterosexuals interviewed for this study had engaged in some homosexual sex play with their male peers as young teenagers. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> not a single one</i> of the 300 heterosexual loveshy men interviewed had ever done this. And not a single one had ever even <i class="calibre4"> wanted</i> to do it. Indeed, all indicated that throughout childhood (as now) they would have been revolted at the mere thought. Then, as now, they wanted to romance a <i class="calibre4"> female, </i> not another male.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, most homosexual males become aware of their romantic-sexual attraction to other males sometime between their tenth and thir-teenth years. It has been found that almost all become aware of this attraction by the time the seventeenth birthday rolls around. The 300</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshy men and the 200 non-shy men studied for this research were all well beyond their seventeenth year in chronological age. Hence, there can be little doubt as to the true heterosexuality of all of the 500 men who were studied for this research.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Closet Heterosexual" Concept</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The term "closet queen" or "closet homosexual" is often used in reference to the "gay" man or woman who has not as yet "come out".</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that this concept is equally useful as a <i class="calibre4"> diagnostic label</i> for the <i class="calibre4">heterosexual</i> man who does not date or informally interact with women even though he would much prefer to be able to do so. To be sure,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"closet homosexuality" is only occasionally caused by shyness*. Indeed, there is evidence that loveshyness is about equally prevalent among the ranks of homosexuals as it is among the ranks of heterosexuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, there probably is no difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals in this regard. .,,.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>124 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, whereas <i class="calibre4"> closet heterosexuality</i> appears to be <i class="calibre4"> almost exclusively</i> caused by severe loveshyness,  <i class="calibre4"> MOST closet homosexuality</i> is due to the fear of being detected by potentially hostile employers, family members, heterosexual friends and acquaintances, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Because of the many constructive social and political changes that were wrought throughout the decades of the 1960s and 1970s, closet homosexuality appears to be a good deal less commonplace today than it formerly had been. Today most homosexuals eventually <i class="calibre4"> do</i> "come out of the closet".</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the evidence is unequivocal that homosexuals have gained enormously in mental health, personal pride and self-esteem as a result of this. As a direct consequence of their "coming out", they have become of far greater value both to themselves and to their respective communities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The only sort of "closet heterosexual" whose lack of social involvement with women may not ordinarily be due to loveshyness is the Roman Catholic priest or brother, Buddhist monk, or other similar religious functionary who for his own religious reasons has taken vows to avoid informal heterosexual interaction with non-family members. Of course, there are some graduate students in American universities who have sold themselves a bill of goods to the effect that they are not really interested in the "distraction" posed by women. Many of these seemingly dedicated and very serious young men have a good deal in common psychologically with the religious functionary who similarly studies books a very great deal and who has taken vows of celebacy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, for many ultra-serious graduate students the avoidance of women for the alleged reason of improving concentration may well constitute more of a "cop out" rationalization than anything else. Research evidence has shown that for all fields of scholarly endeavor, men with a close, loving relationship with a woman earn significantly better grades than do those without the benefit of this. Moreover, after such heterosexually attached men have completed their studies they move ahead in their respective fields significantly faster than do those who had avoided female companionship while in school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it has been found that <i class="calibre4"> unattached</i> male university graduate students (those without girl friends or wives) have a great deal in common psychologically with men studying to become Roman Catholic priests. Using the widely employed <i class="calibre4"> Minnesota Multiphasic Personality</i> <i class="calibre4">Inventory</i> ("MMPI"), several researchers have found that both groups evidence far below average mental and emotional health. In fact, graduate students in psychology and seminary students preparing for the priesthood have both been found to have "MMPI" profiles as bad as those of long-term residents in mental hospitals! For example, both groups tend to score far above average on "schizoid tendencies"—a diagnostic category having to do with social withdrawal and social isolation.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Male Lesbian" Concept</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another potentially useful diagnostic label is that of <i class="calibre4"> "male lesbian" </i>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the surface the whole idea appears ludicrous; everyone knows that lesbians are female homosexuals who want to "make it" vis-a-vis another woman. Yet in selecting the men to be interviewed for this research the seemingly incongruous notion of "male lesbian" kept staring me in the face again and again. For this reason, I don't think that any book pretending to be complete on the subject of chronic loveshyness <i class="calibre4"> in men</i> can afford to ignore the "male lesbian" idea.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically, a "male lesbian" is a heterosexual man who wishes that he had been born a woman, but who (even if he had been a woman) could only make love to another woman and never to a man. Unlike the transsexual, the "male lesbian" does not feel himself to be "a woman trapped inside the body of a man". Moreover, none of the loveshy men studied for this research entertained any wishes or fantasies of any kind pertinent to the idea of obtaining a sex change operation. All wanted to keep their male genitalia; all wanted to remain as males. However, all deeply envied the perogatives of the female gender and truly believed that these perogatives fitted their own inborn temperaments far more harmoniously than the pattern of behavioral expectations to which males are required to adhere. The following represent some typical comments from loveshy males:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"From the time I was very, very young, I had always wished that I had been born a girl. I know I would have been much happier as a girl because I have always been attracted to the kinds of things that girls do. But every time I think about how great it would have been if I had been born a girl, I immediately realize that if I had been born a girl I would be a lesbian. I have always strongly disliked the idea of doing anything with my own sex. I despise men. Just thinking about making love to a man, even as a woman, makes me want to throw up! But I would also never want to play football or baseball or any of the other games boys are supposed to like playing. I never wanted to have <i class="calibre4"> anything</i> to do with the male sex, on any level. So, like if I had been born a girl as 1 would have wanted, I would definitely be a lesbian because I'd be falling in love with and having sex with girls instead of with men." (40-year old heterosexual loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be perfectly frank, I don't think I would be shy at all if it wasn't for this goddam norm that says that only the man can make the first move with a woman in asking for dates. I mean if both sexes had equal responsibility for having to suffer the indignity of having to make the first move, I just know I would have been married fourteen or maybe fifteen years ago." (35-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>126 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I don't know if I'd actually like to be a woman. All I know is that I've always envied women because they can play the passive role and still get married. I think our society is extremely cruel to men. It treats them like second class citizens all the time while women get treated like prima donnas. When you write your book I hope you emphasize the fact that men have feelings too. I mean, men are human beings too, and they have feelings just as much as any woman does. I think it's rotten and stinking the way it's always the man who is made to suffer—like in the military, for example. Just because a person happens to be a male he has to suffer all the horrors and indignities of the military establishment and the selective slavery system. If you're a man you're not supposed to feel any pain. You're not supposed to have any feelings. You're supposed to be just like a piece of steel and press forward no matter what harm or pain comes to you. Well, I was lucky in being able to avoid the military—</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank God! But when it comes to getting a woman there doesn't seem to be any way of getting around these extremely cruel social rules that insist that only the man can be allowed to make the first approach with a woman  . . . . If I was writing a book on shyness I'd hollar and shout on every page that the only way to solve the problem is to change these cruel social rules. You tell your readers that we've got to change the rules. And we've got to keep telling our daughters from the time they are little that they have just as much responsibility as men for making the first move in starting romantic relationships." (38-year old loveshy man.) <i class="calibre4">Male lesbians</i> differ from <i class="calibre4"> both</i> transsexuals <i class="calibre4"> and</i> homosexuals in that they cannot conceive of themselves making love to a man. For example, after sex change surgery the male transsexual almost always wants to begin making love to <i class="calibre4"> a man</i> AS A WOMAN. The male homosexual wants to make love AS A MAN <i class="calibre4"> to a man. </i> The <i class="calibre4"> male lesbian, </i> on the other hand, wishes that he had been born a woman. But he always makes it clear that if he indeed had been born a woman he would be a <i class="calibre4"> full-fledged</i> <i class="calibre4">lesbian. </i> In other words, he would want to socialize exclusively with women and he would choose female partners exclusively for lovemaking and for sexmaking activity. In short, a secret fantasy of many loveshy men is to be a beautiful woman who lives with and makes love with another beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men studied for this book all reluctantly accepted the fact that they are males. And none of them had ever revealed any <i class="calibre4"> transvestite</i> tendencies. Thus, none of them had ever experienced any urge to dress up as a woman or to put on lipstick or nail polish, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Since they could not be a woman, most of them visualized themselves <i class="calibre4"> as a</i> <i class="calibre4">man</i> romancing a beautiful woman. And most of them had begun doing this from a much earlier age in life than had the large majority of non-shy heterosexual men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>How The Information Was Obtained  1 2 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the later chapters of this book will clearly demonstrate, many of the loveshy men studied never liked their own gender very much.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As young children most of them had avoided playmates of their own <i class="calibre4">sex. </i> And most of them had envied the girls' play groups and play activities. They had come to view conventional societal expectations as cruel and callously insensitive because they perceived the girls' peer groups and play activities as being their "natural terrain". Hence, they had often thought to themselves that if they could only find a way of gaining acceptance into the all-female peer group they would find happiness, inner peace and contentment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From a very early age in life onward, the loveshys felt somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">"different" from their male peers. Something inside of themselves told them that they did not belong around male peers. Male peer group activities appeared foreign and often totally unappealing to them. And they tended to view males and their peer group activities with feelings of total and complete alientation and detachment. As one loveshy man expressed it, "Whenever I watched the boys in my school playing I might just as well have been watching a bunch of bear cubs play. I knew they were having a good time; but I just didn't feel that I belonged to their species. I knew that I belonged somewhere else, but I did not know how to find that someplace else." The "someplace else" referred to was, of course, an all-girl peer group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the <i class="calibre4"> male lesbian</i> (1) does not want to play with males, (2) does not want to make love to or experience sex with males, (3) does not have male recreational interests, and (4) does not even want to procreate male children. The vast majority of the loveshy men interviewed for this book confessed that if they ever did become fathers they would want to have <i class="calibre4"> girl</i> children only—NO BOYS. In stark contrast, only one percent of the self-confident, non-shy men felt that way. In fact, the non-shy men preferred the idea of fathering male children to the idea of fathering female children by a ratio of almost three to two.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three Samples Were Studied</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three different samples of men were obtained for this research.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These three groups were as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) 100 single, never married men, all of whom were between the ages of 35 and 50 at the time they were interviewed. Each of these men met all seven of the criteria for loveshyness that were delineated on page 117, the first page of this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) 200 single, never married men, all of whom were (a) full-time or part-time college or university students, and all of whom</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>128 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">were (b) between the ages of 19 and 24 at the time they were interviewed. Each of these men met all seven criteria for loveshyness that were delineated on page 000.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) 200 single, never married men, all of whom were very self-confident and <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> vis-a-vis the opposite sex. These 200 men were all (a) full-time or part-time college or university students; and all of them were (b) between the ages of 19 and 24 at the time they were interviewed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sample #3 is known in the social sciences as a <i class="calibre4"> comparison group. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The non-shy comparison group was composed of people who were very similar to the loveshys on a host of social and demographic background factors. None of the members of this comparison group had any current problems with loveshyness. In essence, none were loveshy. In fact, all 200 members of the comparison group viewed themselves as being above average in social self-confidence vis-a-vis members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Technically speaking, samples <i class="calibre4"> one</i> and <i class="calibre4"> two</i> are known as <i class="calibre4"> "experimental groups". </i> Each of these two samples was composed exclusively of loveshy men. The presence of a comparison group in a research study often permits the making of educated and reasoned deductions about <i class="calibre4">causation. </i> In this study I was very interested in determining the causes of loveshyness and the various factors that may be associated with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The uncovering of lines of causation is what any scientific enterprise is all about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the extent that we are able to arrive at an awareness of the various major causes behind a phenomenon, to that extent we are likely to be in a better position to predict, to control, to cure, and possibly even <i class="calibre4"> to prevent</i> the phenomenon from occurring in the future. In the case of this study on loveshyness, it is possible to deduce probable <i class="calibre4">causes</i> that are responsible for severe shyness by comparing the data obtained for the two loveshy groups (experimental groups) with the data obtained for the comparison group of non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ideally it would have been desirable for me to have included a <i class="calibre4">second</i> comparison group. In other words, it would have been helpful to this research had it been feasible to have a group of non-shy men in the 35 to 50 year old age bracket. The major reason why I chose not to obtain such a comparison group is that the majority of non-shy heterosexual men in the 35 to 50 year age group are married. Married men are no longer involved with the various problems, trials and tribulations pertinent to dating and courtship activities. In fact, their interactional style vis-a-vis the female population is defined and delimited in very significant ways by the fact of being married. To be sure, a sample of non-shy divorced, widowed and separated men could have been drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>How The Information Was Obtained</p>
<p class="calibre1">129</p>
<p class="calibre1">up for this study. But such a sample would hardly have been adequately representative of well-adjusted, non-shy men in the 35 to 50 year old age range.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Limiting the non-shy comparison group to single, never married young men in the 19 to 24 year old age range served this study well in providing the contrast that was required: By comparing and contrasting the backgrounds of the non-shys with those of the loveshys (both groups), it became feasible to arrive at meaningful conclusions as to what the <i class="calibre4"> key causes</i> of loveshyness most probably are. In virtually every comparison that was made, the younger loveshys differed from the non-shys <i class="calibre4"> in exactly the same way as the older loveshys differed from the non-shys. </i> And this fact can be viewed as assuring the reader that the differences which are highlighted between the non-shys and the loveshys are <i class="calibre4"> real differences. </i> In essence, it is likely that many of these differences have a very strong bearing upon the <i class="calibre4"> causes</i> of the loveshyness problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Sample Heterogeneity</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The younger loveshys would be described in social science lingo as a more <i class="calibre4"> heterogeneous</i> group of men than the older loveshys. This means that the <i class="calibre4"> younger</i> loveshys include among their ranks men of a wider range of different prognoses than is the case for the older loveshy men. Simply put, many of the younger loveshys will eventually solve their loveshyness problem (or somehow have it solved for them).</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they will consequently manage to marry and have children as per their very strong desires.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, we may rightly suspect that very few of the <i class="calibre4">older</i> loveshys will ever be able to marry and have children according to their desires. United States Government statistics indicate that only about 5 <i class="calibre4"> percent</i> of men still "single, never married" after age 35, will <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> marry. Thus it would seem to be a good guess that for the severely and chronically loveshy single, never married, the percent <i class="calibre4"> ever marrying</i> beyond the age of 35 is most probably a good deal lower than 5!</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, we may speculate that the younger loveshy men include among their ranks <i class="calibre4"> some</i> individuals who will go on to become 35 to 50</p>
<p class="calibre1">year old "single, never married" loveshys. On the other hand, it is also quite likely that at least half of these younger loveshy men will eventually work out a way of getting their loveshyness problem solved <i class="calibre4"> before</i> becoming old enough to qualify for entrance into a group of 35 to 50</p>
<p class="calibre1">year old heterosexual loveshy virgins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the younger loveshys represent a more heterogeneous group than the older loveshys do, we may reasonably expect that most facets of their backgrounds are probably less extreme than those of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>130 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">older loveshys. In other words, we can expect that most of the behavioral and background differences between the non-shys and the loveshys will be <i class="calibre4"> substantially less</i> for the younger loveshys than for the older ones. Thus when the loveshy men are compared to the non-shy men, the younger loveshys can be expected to be a lot more similar to the non-shys than the older loveshy men can be expected to be. And this is exactly what was found as will become clear to the reader as he/she makes his/her way through this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, the younger (university) loveshy men probably include significantly fewer intractable cases. All of these younger men do indeed suffer from severe and chronic loveshyness. But for many of them it is likely that events will ultimately conspire at some future time to relieve their painful inability to obtain meaningful and rewarding female companionship. Much of the young lives of these men had already been wasted as far as their not having been able to experience or enjoy any kind of a social life was concerned. Again, for many of the younger loveshys this inability and lack might ultimately prove quite temporary; for the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshys it will ultimately prove tragically permanent.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Reliability</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A</i> key advantage behind studying two different samples of loveshy men is that an opportunity is provided for ascertaining the <i class="calibre4"> reliability</i> of findings. The term "reliability" here means <i class="calibre4"> repeatability. </i> Every researcher must be concerned about whether different samples of people with the same problem will reflect the same pattern of findings. If the findings obtained for one group of loveshy men turn out quite different from the findings obtained for a second group of loveshy men, there might be good reason to question the accuracy and validity of any conclusions that might be drawn. Simply put, if research findings turn out to be quite different for two groups of the <i class="calibre4"> same (loveshy)</i> description, serious doubt would be cast upon the overall reliability of any of the obtained findings. On the other hand, if essentially the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> findings accrued for two totally separate groups of loveshy men, we could be reasonably confident as to the <i class="calibre4"> reliability</i> (repeatability) of the data. In essence, we could feel reasonably confident about obtaining basically the same research findings for <i class="calibre4"> any</i> group of loveshy men we might choose to study, no matter where in the western world those loveshy men might reside.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, one note of caution is in order here. It is of the utmost importance that different researchers working in different geographic areas obtain their loveshy samples using the same criteria as to what does and does not constitute loveshyness. To the extent that different</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 131</p>
<p class="calibre1">researchers define "loveshyness" in different ways, quite different findings can quite legitimately be expected with each new study that is published.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As mentioned earlier, Philip Zimbardo employed a very loose approach for determining who is and who is not shy. He simply asked people whether or not they consider themselves to be shy. And 42</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent usually said "yes". Now 42 percent is a rather large fraction of the population. Moreover, most of the 42 percent who said "yes" did not have their day-to-day lives "cramped" or harmed to any <i class="calibre4"> major</i> extent by their respective shyness problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, when I first began the study to be dealt with in this book I realized that the lives of certain victims of shyness are <i class="calibre4">severely</i> harmed and encroached upon by loveshyness. After all, if a person cannot date at all, if he is deprived of any opportunities for marriage, sexual expression (apart from masturbation), and from family formation, etc., then it is quite clear that his shyness wields a continuing and very destructive, debilitating impact upon his life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, I decided that it was this highly debilitating, chronic and intractable type of shyness that was really worth studying. This is not to imply that lesser kinds of shyness are unimportant or that they are not worth studying and understanding. The point is that we need to get a good grip on the more serious varieties of the problem first because they cause the most suffering and wastage of human resources. The fact that a very high proportion of the less serious forms of shyness undergo spontaneous remission seems to further suggest that the everyday "gar-den variety" shyness may have a very different constellation of underlying causes than the more serious forms of loveshyness that are dealt with in this book. And indeed if the causes are different, then different forms of therapy and of preventive efforts may ultimately be warrented.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Prevalence of LoveShyness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">My own analysis has convinced me that at any given point in time about 1.5 percent of all American heterosexual males suffer from severe loveshyness. Thus chronic loveshyness among heterosexual males is probably somewhat less commonplace than is homosexuality. However, the <i class="calibre4"> total number</i> of American males afflicted at any given point in time is actually quite high. I would place the figure at approximately 1,695,000.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, I think there is good reason to suspect that there are presently in excess of one-and-one-half million severely loveshy males resident in the United States. This estimate includes males of all ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It does <i class="calibre4"> not</i> include women, and it does not include homosexuals of either</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>132 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">gender. Further, I think there is good reason to suspect that the large, urban centers of the United States attract more than their proportional share of the loveshy. This is particularly true for the New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, New Orleans, Chicago, and Seattle metropolitan areas.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">How the Respondents Were Obtained</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1979, Auburn University accorded me a sizable financial grant for purposes of studying the loveshyness problem. This grant served two very important purposes: (1) it lent an ambiance of importance and respectability to the project; and (2) it enabled me to pay each cooperative respondent a small amount for his time. To be sure, $10 is not very much money for an extensive interview that often lasted in excess of three hours. Nevertheless, money talks; and even a small amount of it has a way of opening doors and assuring a high level of quality cooperation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Younger LoveShy Men</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The cooperation of 200 19 to 24 year old men (all with the <i class="calibre4"> seven</i> <i class="calibre4">loveshyness characteristics</i> delineated on page 000) was obtained from the following seven campuses: (1) University of California at Los Angeles; (2) California State University at Northridge; (3) New York University; (4) City University of New York; (5) Auburn University; (6) Westfield State College; and (7) State University of New York at Stony Brook. In addition, 24 men (12 percent of the total sample) were drawn from the membership of a New York area commercial dating service. All of these men were similarly enrolled in classes at a number of area colleges.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With the exception of the 25 men interviewed on the Auburn University campus in Auburn, Alabama, all of the younger loveshys had grown up in the suburbs of major west and east coast metropolitan areas. Parenthetically, there is no evidence that the 25 Auburn loveshys were any less severely afflicted with their problem than their 175 fellow sufferers from the much more highly urbanized west and east coasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the obtaining of the university respondents, announcements were placed on bulletin boards in (1) classroom buildings, (2) in dormitories, and (3) in off-campus laundermats. These announcements briefly described the nature of the study and the type of respondents that would be needed. They also indicated the $10 reward that would be accorded the appropriate individuals for participation in the study.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 133</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had already been aware of the fact that loveshy people seldom have telephones. In fact, severely loveshy people often find it too threatening to use a telephone even for the making of impersonal, business contacts. Since loveshy men often choose to write letters in situations wherein most people would simply opt to make a telephone call, the bulletin board announcements that were used all requested that interested men contact me by mail at a clearly delineated address.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because I was inviting responses from severely shy young men who often harbor strong inhibitions blocking self-disclosure vis-a-vis strangers, I wanted to make the announcements as (1) nonthreatening, and (2) inviting, as I possibly could. I also wanted to arouse the loveshys' curiosity. I therefore pointed out that I was a licensed therapeutic counselor in the State of California, and that I was particularly interested in finding ways whereby the social system could be restructured so as to better meet the needs of loveshy men. Hence, the announcements all stated that young men who were very shy vis-a-vis women had long been totally ignored by politicians, university and college administrators, social event coordinators; and that the time had finally come for something constructive to be done to remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, most of what little research work has been done on shyness has started off from the basic premise that shyness is the <i class="calibre4"> victim's</i> problem, the <i class="calibre4"> victim's</i> fault, and the <i class="calibre4"> victim's</i> responsibility. It has started off from the premise that any ultimate remedy for the shyness problem would have to come from the <i class="calibre4"> victim himself. </i> In contrast, the bulletin board announcements used for this study proclaimed the fact that loveshy men are human beings as worthy of dignity and respect as anyone else; and that <i class="calibre4"> society</i> had a responsibility in the <i class="calibre4"> causing</i> and ultimately in the <i class="calibre4"> prevention and cure</i> of loveshyness. In addition, the announcements clearly indicated a recognition of the fact that loveshyness is by far the most painful and life-destructive of all the various forms of shyness—and that it is the form of shyness that requires the most immediate attention from the "powers that be".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally the bulletin board announcements briefly described the essential respondent characteristics that the study would require. For example, in order to qualify for an interview and for the $10 payment, each respondent would have to be (1) heterosexual; (2) male; (3) virginal; (4) never or very rarely dates; (5) for a very long time desperately desirous of the emotionally meaningful love and companionship of a member of the opposite sex; (6) lacking any history of emotionally meaningful involvement (other than through fantasies and daydreams) with the other sex; and (7) extremely anxiety-prone at the mere thought of friendly self-assertion vis-a-vis a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This bulletin board method worked, although progress was slow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over a lengthy period of time letters trickled in from interested potential</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>134 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">respondents. And each respondent was contacted in person and screened.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the people who contacted me could not be used for the study because they did not fit one or more of the seven delineated criteria.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, better than eighty percent of those who wrote to me did fit all of the criteria and were eventually interviewed—in most cases within a few days of the original contact by mail.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The bulletin board announcements had requested that respondents specify the times and places that would prove convenient and comfortable for them. Of course, privacy and security from interruptions had to be assured; and these matters posed little problem. A three-hour time block had to be secured; and that similarly posed fewer problems than I had anticipated. In fact, many of the interviews ran beyond four hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People with strong inhibitions against self-disclosure often "open up"</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprisingly well when they are with somebody who shows a sincere interest in them, and who makes himself known as someone who is looking for ways of catalyzing society into taking steps towards the direct helping of loveshy people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I, the author of this book, am the person who conducted all of the interviews for the study. I accomplished this by going to the appointed place at the appointed time as mutually agreed beforehand by letter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With some respondents two or three or even four letters prefaced the actual interview. Some respondents needed various types of assurances.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in some cases interview appointments had to be changed or confirmed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, some of the information required for this study had to be obtained by self-administered questionnaire. All such information was obtained with me (the interviewer) present in the room. This procedure proved quite helpful because (1) it enabled respondents to receive prompt and immediate answers to any questions they might have had concerning certain questionnaire items; and (2) it prevented a lot of time-consuming callbacks. Simply put, the procedure employed for the data collecting phase of this study assured that when I left a particular respondent I had in my possession all of the data that would be required from that respondent. I did not have to depend upon any respondent to mail me any data. To depend on respondents to mail information can be very frustrating because initially enthusiastic respondents often lose interest; and much of the information that the research requires never actually gets received.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Socially Self-Confident Non-Shy Men</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the younger loveshys, the non-shy men were similarly in the age range from 19 to 24; and there were 200 of them. Their cooperation was obtained in much the same way as it had been obtained for the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 135</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshys, except that contact was requested by telephone rather than by letter. Non-shy individuals are usually quite averse to letter writing, and they will normally do everything within their power to avoid having to put pen to paper. Their style is always to communicate directly with people on a face-to-face basis, or by telephone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The posted announcements for the non-shy men did not indicate that the required respondents were to comprise merely a <i class="calibre4"> "comparison</i> <i class="calibre4">group", </i> or that the subject of the research was loveshyness or, for that matter, any other kind of shyness. I felt that any mention of "shyness"</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the posted announcements might serve to turn off potentially good respondents. On the other hand, the $10 reward was mentioned; and the subject of the research investigation was delineated as being that of young men who are socially successful with women and who engage in a great deal of informal heterosexual interaction including dating, partying, lovemaking, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Inquiries came in from non-shy men at a much, much faster pace than they came in from the loveshys. Of course, this was to be expected, given the many anxieties and fears which loveshy males entertain regarding self-disclosure and self-assertion. The net result of this differential was that I could have easily obtained all 200 non-shy men from the same university and had the non-shy data collection phase of the research over and done with very early. However, I decided that it was not in the best interests of the study to do this, and that the best "comparison group" would be one composed of young men from the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> seven universities as those used for obtaining the loveshys. I similarly decided that each university should contribute approximately the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> <i class="calibre4">number</i> of respondents to each of the two categories: (1) loveshy, and (2) self-confident non-shy. This was done, and the number of men interviewed from each of the schools was as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre1">U.C.L.A.: 62 loveshys and 62 non-shys;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cal State Northridge: 32 loveshys and 32 non-shys; New York University: 20 loveshys and 28 non-shys; C.U.N.Y.: 14 loveshys and 22 non-shys;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Auburn University: 25 loveshys and 25 non-shys;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Westfield State College: 14 loveshys and 14 non-shys; S.U.N.Y. at Stony Brook: 9 loveshys and 17 non-shys; The 24 younger loveshys who were drawn from the membership of a commercial dating service were all in attendance, full-time or part-time, at other New York area colleges.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>136 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for a young man to qualify for inclusion into the non-shy sample, each of the following six criteria had to be met: (1) Each respondent had to be heterosexual;</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) Each respondent had to be "single, never married"; (3) Each respondent had to be of the male gender;</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) Each respondent had to consider himself happily self-confident and relaxed in informal interactions vis-a-vis the opposite sex; (5) Each respondent had to be actively involved in a social life that included daily informal social interaction with the opposite sex; (6) Each respondent had to be in the 19 to 24 year age range.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No minimum number of dates with women per week or per month was required for inclusion in the non-shy sample. Unlike the situation that prevailed twenty or more years ago, young people today differ quite a bit from one another in terms of how they choose to define the word</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"date". </i> Moreover, 38 percent of the non-shys studied were premaritally cohabiting with a lover; and most of these men did not view themselves as being involved in "dating" at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the United States there continues to exist some quite thoroughly self-confident non-shy young men who <i class="calibre4"> CHOOSE</i> to remain virginal because of certain deeply internalized religious values which are very important to them. The key word here is <i class="calibre4"> "choice". </i> As I have reiterated at several points in this book, shyness removes "choice" from its victims, and with it a full sense of personal responsibility for both behavior and behavioral <i class="calibre4"> inaction. </i> Of course, better than a score of social science investigations have revealed that for both sexes there is an <i class="calibre4"> inverse</i> association between sociability (including social self-confidence) and choosing to remain virginal until marriage. In short, socially successful young people seldom choose to remain virginal. But there are individual exceptions to all statistical generalizations. And a minority of very attractive, highly sociable, socially self-confident young men and women do manage, by choice, to remain virginal until marriage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this particular study only 6 of the 200 self-confident non-shy men (3 percent) were virginal. Three of these came from the Auburn University sample; two came from Cal State University at Northridge, and one came from the Westfield State College sample. In short, 97</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shys were sexually experienced. Further, a majority of this 97 percent had had a considerable amount of premarital coital experience—although most of their sexual experiences had been enjoyed on a monogamo.us basis. In other words, most of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>How The Information Was Obtained 137</p>
<p class="calibre1">non-shy men had incorporated their premarital sex into love relationships which had been stable and constant throughout most of their duration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the non-shys had been involved in three or four love relationships which had incorporated sexual intercourse. And 53 percent had cohabited with a girl for a period of at least six or more months; 38</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of them were cohabiting at the time they were interviewed for this study.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The SHI Inventory</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I had to find some means for quickly and accurately assessing each potential respondent with respect to criterion #4. Each non-shy respondent had to consider himself happily self-confident and relaxed in informal social interactions vis-a-vis the opposite sex. A substantial minority of the seemingly non-shy men who contacted me appeared to be primarily interested in earning a quick $10, and in assuaging their curiosity about the nature of the research. Thus inappropriate individuals had to be screened out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards this end I used an instrument devised during the early 1970s by psychologists Craig Twentyman and Richard McFall. This instrument is known as the <i class="calibre4"> Survey of Heterosexual Interactions, </i> or "SHI Inventory". Up to now the SHI remains the only diagnostic device for assessing the extent of loveshyness in males which has the advantage of national norms. Thus the SHI Inventory is now a standardized test with national norms which are based upon the scores of over 10,000</p>
