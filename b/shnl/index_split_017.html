<p class="calibre1">And of relevance to encounter group therapy was the following statement: "Sitting on the floor or on the ground is very uncomfortable for me." Fully 73 percent of the older loveshys along with 51 percent of the younger loveshys agreed. In contrast, only 27 percent of the non-shy men agreed. In fact, several of the loveshys claimed that sitting on the ground for more than ten or fifteen minutes invariably caused their legs and arms to begin hurting. Of course, several others also claimed that sitting on the floor was "unsanitary" because it necessitates placing hands on that which people walk upon. This issue will be dealt with more fully in section three of this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"></a>4 0 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Annoyance at Petty Stimuli</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men show considerable evidence of being unusually irked and annoyed by minor stimuli. In addition, it appears that certain stimuli such as minor discomforts (e.g., a rough fingernail) can distract them to a far greater extent than such stimuli can distract most people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In some cases this tendency to be easily annoyed may be nothing more than a byproduct of chronic isolation from people. Thus the tendency to become easily annoyed may more often be a <i class="calibre4"> consequence</i> of loveshyness rather than a cause. On the other hand, extreme manifestations of hypersensitivity may to some extent be rooted in inborn, genetically based considerations. In short, loveshy people may have a lower inborn threshold with respect to the experiencing of certain kinds of stimuli.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And if this is so, these same hypersensitivities may also be partly responsible for the heightened self-consciousness which loveshy men commonly feel when they are around people in purely social situations wherein there is no script.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the issue of the rough fingernail. Of course, women might be somewhat more likely than men to agree that a rough fingernail is disconcerting or distracting. But I suspect that a woman's concern here might more usually be attributable to concern for personal appearance than concern about bodily discomfort. The fact that the non-shys were less than one-twentieth as likely as the loveshys to be bothered by a rough fingernail may reflect (at least in part) a greater ability on their part to <i class="calibre4"> "lose themselves" </i> in the many activities in which they are involved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ability to become "lost" in what one is doing has long been recognized as an index of mental health, happiness and adjustment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In lacking such adjustment the loveshy are often unable to "lose themselves" even when they are involved in activities which they enjoy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus this inability to become lost in what they are doing might well render them much more likely than the majority of people to notice and to be distracted by a rough fingernail, bodily itches, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In essence, the very active tend to be so thoroughly involved with life that such minor stimuli would not even be noticed or recognized in most cases as a bodily discomfort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like rough fingernails and bodily itches, grains of sand in one's shoes may well be more readily ignored by highly active people. But then again the speed with which a person is likely to notice a grain of sand in his shoes may itself be partly a function of an inborn, genetically based discomfort threshold. In this regard I asked each man: "To what extent could you walk around with a small grain of sand in one of your shoes and not be aware of it?" And 98 percent of the older loveshys together with 81 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that it would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue 405</p>
<p class="calibre1">be <i class="calibre4"> "quite likely" </i> that they would be aware of such a grain of sand. Only 41 percent of the self-confident non-shys felt likewise. Of course, 41</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent is a much higher figure than the 2 percent of the non-shys who would be aware of a rough fingernail. However, what is really impressive here is the <i class="calibre4"> significantly greater sensitivity</i> of the loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, fully 33 percent of the non-shy men indicated that they would probably not be aware at all of such a grain of sand in their shoes. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys and just 4 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they would probably not be aware of a grain of sand in their shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' unusually high level of sensitivity can similarly be observed in the pattern of responses to this question: "If you felt a grain of sand in your shoe, how likely would you be to stop within 30 seconds, take your shoe off and dump it out?" And 100 percent of the older loveshys along with <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of the younger loveshys indicated that they would be "quite likely to stop and dump it out". In contrast, this was true for only 38 percent of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loud, sudden noises also bother the loveshy a good deal more than they bother the non-shy. Hence, the loveshy tend to be substantially more sensitive than the non-shy to the antics of extroverted boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked for reactions to this statement: "I hate it when extroverted, joyriding youths bellow crazy remarks out of their car windows at passing pedestrians." And 97 percent of the older loveshys along with 81 percent of the younger loveshys replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, only 18 percent of the non-shy men saw fit to agree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as I have already pointed out, most loveshys absolutely despise any type of rock music. It is worth underscoring the point that they hate such music for esthetic reasons, and not for moral ones. As several loveshys pointed out in the interviews, "it violates my esthetic sensibilities".</p>
<p class="calibre1">And more than one loveshy man asserted that "rock music is no more comfortable to listen to than the incessant roar of a jackhammer digging up a city street."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Eye Color and Hair Strand Width</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Is eye color related to loveshyness? Probably not. But for whatever it may be worth, I did find an interesting difference here. Fully 38 percent of the older loveshys and 36 percent of the younger loveshys had <i class="calibre4"> blue</i> <i class="calibre4">eyes. </i> In contrast, only 21 percent of the self-confident non-shys had <i class="calibre4"> blue</i> <i class="calibre4">eyes. </i> Of course, blue eyes are caused by a recessive gene. And it could be that inhibition might be mildly related to the presence of that gene.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"></a>4 0 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, I asked for reactions to this statement: "The width of each of the strands of hair on my head appears to be a great deal narrower (thinner) than most people's hair." And 46 percent of the older loveshys together with 39 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4"> agreed. </i> In contrast, only 7 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed. Down through the ages many philosophers have believed hair strand width to be related to inhibition, social withdrawal tendencies, and psychoemotional sensitivity. These data would certainly appear to back up such philosophical speculations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some Concluding Observations</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wender and Klein (1981) cite an unpublished paper by Seymour Kety and Dennis Kinney, in which evidence was presented linking extreme shyness (and schizoid personality) with high wheat and rye consumption. Very shy men tend to eat a great deal of breakfast cereal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, some of them appear to eat far more of high-wheat cereals than what could be considered typical of Americans generally. And they also tend to have a strong preference for citrus fruits over other types of fruits—another food predilection that has been found to be strongly associated with extreme introversion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychiatrists Kety and Kinney conducted two studies involving wheat consumption. Each of the two studies contained an experimental group and a control group. Schizoid personalities in the experimental groups had sharply reduced their intake of high-wheat cereals whereas the schizoids in the control groups continued eating the high-wheat diet to which they had grown accustomed. In both experiments the experimental subjects (low wheat diet) gradually became progressively more sociable and less schizoid in their behavior than the controls (high wheat diet).</p>
<p class="calibre1">If these findings continue to hold up over time, then it may be that extremely shy people in many cases have a food allergy—to wheat—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which interacts with genetic susceptibility in such a way as to produce deviant degrees of behavioral inhibition, timidity, shyness, and low initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, there is a possibility that severely loveshy people inherit a genetic susceptibility to invasion (early in life) by a schizoid-inducing virus. Over twenty studies during the past four decades have shown a consistent 5 to 15 percent increase in pre-schizoid births during the winter and spring months as compared to the other months of the year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This phenomenon has been reported for a large array of both northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere countries—although the effect</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"></a>LoveShyness and the Innate Sensitivities Issue  4 0 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">tends to be most marked in geographical areas wherein seasonal vari-ations are decidedly pronounced. In view of the fact that the loveshy males studied for this book tended to be especially likely to have been born in the spring (see chapter 4), this is a potentially noteworthy finding the nature of which deserves careful investigation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">According to Wender and Klein (1981), researchers have hypothesized that this increase in pre-schizoid births during late winter and spring may be associated with a greater than average susceptibility (among those with an initially weak constitution) to infectious diseases during that time of the year, and to a greater prevalence of viruses at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It needs to be stressed that we are still in the kindergarten of awareness as to what is actually going on here. And it is clear that an enormous amount of new research on the biological/physiological/genetic basis of severe shyness is sorely needed.</p>

<a id="p440"></a>Chapter 17</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Some Psychological Characteristics</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">of the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In looking over the wide range of information I collected for this book I discovered many items upon which there were enormous differences between the loveshys and the non-shys. A large portion of these items concerned matters of pertinence to style of thinking, personal introspection, and psychoemotional make-up. The primary purpose of this chapter is to fill out the picture on what loveshy men are really like as human beings "deep down inside".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Being Friendly Requires Nerve</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most Americans regard open friendliness as the "natural" state of affairs. Indeed, seemingly unfriendly people are often viewed with suspicion, and they are typically seen as being hostile. At best they are avoided, and they are commonly labeled as "weird" or worse. This is particularly true as far as males are concerned. Unfriendly women are merely likely to be viewed as diffident and perhaps rightfully suspicious vis-a-vis people whom they dont' know. In contrast, unfriendly or seemingly "weird" men tend to be viewed in a hostile fashion. And as a consequence they are ignored or shunned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Important too is the very widespread tendency to equate behavior with attitude. Simply put, if a person behaves in an unfriendly manner, we tend to view his <i class="calibre4"> attitude</i> as being unfriendly—even when it is anything but unfriendly. People cannot react and respond to that which they cannot see. Similarly, if a young man is never observed interacting informally with women and if he is always seen alone, the natural tendency is to perceive him as being a homosexual, or perhaps as a "closet queen". And this is true irrespective of how thoroughly heterosexual in predilections that person might indeed be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4 0 9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"></a>4 1 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, very few people are telepathic. And even those who are may be turned off by the sensing of a strong feeling of negativity and doleful sourness in a loveshy man's aura. The point that needs to be stressed, however, is that for the loveshy attitudes and overt behaviors seldom coincide. The loveshy person cannot command his performance in the direction of his wishes because he is not in the "driver's seat" of his own life. A loveshy man may sustain very liberal, humanitarian attitudes towards others. But due to the fact that he constantly avoids informal social interaction he is likely to be perceived by others as being anything but humanitarian, and anything but "warm and caring".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, most Americans judge others <i class="calibre4"> by what they can see. </i> Attitudes and values cannot be directly observed. And in fact they remain entirely hidden unless and until the person holding them opens up and shares them with others. And even then he may not be believed if his <i class="calibre4"> observable</i> <i class="calibre4">behavior</i> continues on in a highly asocial, socially avoidant fashion—or in a fashion that appears to contradict the substance of what he says.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the cliched expression: "Your actions speak so loudly I cannot hear a word you are saying!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's look at a few examples of these social avoidance tendencies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "It requires a tremendous amount of nerve to be friendly with people." And <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys said that they agreed. In contrast, fully 52</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys and 76 percent of the older loveshys indicated that they agreed with that statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Focusing attention upon the opposite sex I asked for reactions to this statement: "It requires a tremendous amount of nerve to be friendly with the opposite sex." And here again,  <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men agreed. In contrast, fully 100 percent of the older loveshy men together with <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of the younger loveshys agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even more illustrative of the loveshys' behavioral and psychoemotional thought style was the pattern of responses to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would sooner avoid someone I know on the street than risk accidentally saying 'hello' to a stranger."  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the non-shy men endorsed this statement. In contrast, fully 87 percent of the older loveshys along with 68 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that the statement was true for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Extreme Self-Consciousness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A well nigh universal behavior trait of the loveshy is <i class="calibre4"> extreme self-consciousness</i> when in or near the company of an eligible woman. In essence, the loveshy are intensely preoccupied with the self and cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy  4 1 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">"let go and let God". Intense self-preoccupation is, of course, the same phenomenon as extreme <i class="calibre4"> tenseness. </i> Loveshys are quite unable to relax when in the company of (or anywhere near) a potentially eligible female.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this inability to relax not only ushers in painful anxiety spells, but it also makes clear-headed thinking and communicating virtually impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The minds of virtually all human beings function best and most efficiently when they are relaxed and comfortable. Tension creates a phenomenon known as <i class="calibre4"> "tunnel vision". </i> Afflicted by tunnel vision (the <i class="calibre4">natural</i> outcome of feeling tense, worried, and intensely self-conscious), ideas for topics of conversation simply cannot and do not come to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Effective small talk absolutely requires a relaxed, comfortable feeling of mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, taking an examination under conditions of a very worried, tense state of mind makes it extremely difficult for a person to do his/her best. The right answers just do not seem to come to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The student might have indeed learned the material very thoroughly; but the worry and the tensed-up feeling <i class="calibre4"> blocks and constricts</i> the "pipe-lines" of truth and knowledge that serve as a conduit for the required facts from the brain's storehouse or memory banks into the conscious mind. This is the essence of "tunnel vision". In contrast, when the person is relaxed and confident and positive in mental attitude, the right answers all manage to quite easily pass into conscious awareness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it is in situations wherein there is no purpose apart from pure, unadulterated sociability. When the fear of the likelihood of anxiety (anticipatory anxiety) causes the person to tense up and to become extremely preoccupied with his own self instead of with the person with whom he is talking, he finds that his mind goes completely blank—</p>
<p class="calibre1">which contributes to an even worstening of the anxiety-and relevant ideas just don't come to mind. Immediately upon leaving the anxiety-provoking social encounter, on the other hand, hundreds of very good ideas suddenly flood the mind—because the anxiety and tenseness stimulus has been removed. But it is then too late!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Telephones</p>
<p class="calibre1">If loveshy men are made nervous by the mere thought of purely sociable, friendly interaction on a face-to-face basis with others, the idea of using a telephone does not operate to make them feel anymore comfortable. For example, 100 percent of the older loveshys agreed with the statement: "Telephones have always made me nervous." The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was 76 percent. In contrast, just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"></a>4 1 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">11 percent of the non-shys agreed with the statement. (A figure as high as 11 percent might well be considered surprisingly high for the non-shys, given their tendency not to fear face-to-face interaction.) And the loveshys had evidently learned to adapt to their fear of telephones. Many of them dealt with their telephone aversion by writing letters when they had to communicate with someone. For example, 41</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 30 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that if given a choice they would invariably choose to write someone a letter in lieu of calling them on the telephone.  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shys indicated that they would resort to letter-writing in lieu of making a telephone call.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, only 3 percent of the older loveshys kept telephones in their private apartments. The analogous figure for the younger loveshys was 23 percent. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the non-shy men kept a private telephone in their place of abode.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Assertion Phobia</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides being "people-phobes", the loveshy appear to possess strong phobias regarding even the simplest forms of social assertiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, consider this statement: "Lots of times when I am eating among a group of people I do without salt because I haven't got the nerve to ask someone to pass me the salt shaker."  <i class="calibre4"> Zero percent</i> of the non-shy men indicated "yes" to this statement. Yet fully 37 percent of the younger loveshys and 58 percent of the older loveshys would sooner do without salt than ask someone to pass it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This question regarding "the passing of the saltshaker" illustrates as poignantly as anything the sheer <i class="calibre4"> social invisibility</i> of the loveshy. A person can only become visible and noticed to the extent that he takes some social risks and asserts himself. The loveshy had learned to sustain a self-imposed camouflage; the net result of this is that whenever they are amidst a group of interacting persons they are "invisible"—they are there in body but not in spirit. And this is reflected in the virtually universal tendency among the loveshy to enter into a world of daydreams whenever they are amongst a group of interacting people—</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless one of the people whom they are with makes the first move towards starting a conversation. Then and only then does the loveshy person "open up".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Asking for directions represents another example of this fear of self-assertion. I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "I would have to drive many miles out of my way before I would ever be able to get up enough nerve to ask someone for directions." Fully 46</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy  4 1 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys together with 34 percent of the younger loveshys indicated that this was true for themselves. In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the non-shys revealed any inhibitions at all about asking people for directions.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A Life-Threatening Scenario</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose that your physician together with several of his/her esteemed specialist colleagues got together and told you that you had only six months to live. Suppose that they further advised you that for at least the first five of these six months your activities need not be impeded in any way. In other words, you will be able to do virtually anything that you wish to do for the first five of your remaining six months of life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This scenario has become a favorite of motivational psychologists who travel around the United States and Canada trying to inspire people towards using their valuable time more productively, happily and effectively. Accordingly, I presented it to all 500 of the men who were interviewed for this book. I wanted to get their reactions as I was particularly curious as to whether or not the loveshys would respond to it noticeably different than the non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The differences I obtained turned out to be quite remarkable. For example, not one man among the 100 older loveshys believed that his life style would change very much at all—especially from the standpoint of his relationships vis-a-vis other people. In essence, for the typical loveshy man, the fear of experiencing anxiety in social situations is more forbidding than the fear of death itself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A few of the loveshys told me that they would take everything out of their bank accounts and use much of their remaining time traveling. And a few of them would use this as an opportunity to cheat their credit card companies. Some of them spoke about quitting their jobs and spending endless hours listening to their stereos, watching television, or going to the movies. However,  <i class="calibre4"> none of them</i> (and this is the important point) seriously thought that the six-month time limit would in any way have the effect of making it any easier for them to approach a woman, or for them to risk rejection in purely sociable, social situations. The following might be considered typical of the responses I received from the older loveshy men:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I'd certainly quit this stupid-ass job; I know that much! Then I guess I'd take everything out of my bank account and I'd use the whole time just traveling all over the place. I'd probably also get all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"></a>414 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cash I could from these so-called credit card loans. Like if I only had five months I might as well get all I can. They're not going to be able to take any action against me if I'm going to be dead!  . . . .</p>
<p class="calibre1">I know what I'd really like to do. I'd really like to just get myself a really fabulous woman and just do nothing but have constant sex for six months. But I know I'd never be able to even ask a girl out, much less have sex. Even with only six months to live, I know I'd just flip out of my gorge just to even think about approaching a pretty woman. I just couldn't take the anxiety. The fact that I had only six months to live wouldn't make a damn bit of difference because I'd still have to deal with the anxiety. And I know that I'd never be able to deal with the anxiety. Like I told you, I can't even <i class="calibre4">think</i> about starting a conversation with some woman who is attractive to me. It blows my mind too much. So I'd just use the remaining time traveling. That's a whole lot better than nothing." (44-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, the responses of the younger loveshys were little different from those of the older ones. On the other hand, the non-shy men tended to phrase their responses strictly in terms of their personal involvements with friends, lovers, relatives, and other loved ones. Many of the non-shys would also travel. But all would do so with a lover and/</p>
<p class="calibre1">or with close friends and family.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Items Clearly Earmarking the LoveShy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the statements which I presented to all respondents sharply differentiated the loveshy from the non-shy. In essence, these are statements which were reacted to very differently by the loveshy men than by the non-shy men. For the interest and convenience of the reader a representative sampling of these statements is provided below.

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p448"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy  4 1 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Sense of Humor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sense of humor is one of the most important ingredients of what American women deem to be a winning personality in a man. Hundreds of research studies on dating and courtship have shown this to be true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, several studies pertaining to success in marriage have similarly shown <i class="calibre4"> "sense of humor" </i> to be a factor of formidable predictive value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly it is no laughing matter! A successful marriage requires mutual compassion; and compassion requires communication. A relaxed sense of humor constitutes a major element of communication skills.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is precisely with respect to sense of humor that one can easily appreciate how "the rich get richer while the poor get poorer." The loveshy had gone through so much unhappiness and negativity throughout their formative years that it soured their personalities and removed what little sense of humor they might once have had. Indeed, the loveshys'</p>
<p class="calibre1">pasts probably developed in them a trained incapacity for even developing much of a sense of humor. Their past experiences had made them extremely self-centered, self-conscious, and self-preoccupied. And it is very difficult for such a personality to relax and to be naturally spontaneous enough to "roll with the punches" and to display any humor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This can be seen quite clearly and poignantly in the pattern of responses to this question: "Compared to most people, about how often would you say you laugh?" Fully 100 percent of the non-shy men checked either "often" or "very often", compared to just 22 percent of the younger loveshys and a mere 6 percent of the older loveshy men. On the other hand, fully 63 percent of the older loveshy men together with 45 percent of the younger ones indicated that they seldom laugh.  <i class="calibre4"> Nobody</i> among the non-shys indicated that he seldom laughs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I simply asked: "In general, do you find it easy to laugh?" And fully 100 percent of the non-shy men said "yes", compared to only 20 percent of the older loveshys along with 34 percent of the younger loveshys. Several of the loveshy respondents told me that as young children they had been able to laugh quite easily, but that they had somehow lost the ability over the years. Indeed, one 39-year old loveshy man told me that it has probably been approximately twenty years since the last time he had laughed. Other loveshys made similar albeit less extreme comments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The ability to spontaneously laugh is important not only from the standpoint of being looked upon favorably by others, but also from the standpoint of sheer physical (medical) health and longevity. Several studies have shown that laughing aids digestion, circulation, blood pressure, and many of the metabolic processes that pertain to the generation</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p449"></a>4 1 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">of life-preserving enzymes and enzyme activity. The fact that the ability to spontaneously laugh has a strong bearing upon mental health surely goes without saying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 100 percent of the non-shy men agreed that they "get a lot of fun out of life". This too, it would seem, has a strong bearing upon the sense of humor a person is likely to be perceived by other people as having. Only 23 percent of the older loveshys and 35 percent of the younger loveshys could similarly concur with the statement that they get "a lot of fun out of life". And in a related question I asked:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some people seem to be good at being happy; they enjoy life regardless of what is going on, get the most out of everything. Others are the opposite; they never are as happy as they might be. Where do you fall?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 95 percent of the non-shy men indicated that they were "very good at being happy". This was true for only 4 percent of the older loveshy men and 11 percent of the younger loveshys. In contrast, 96 percent of the older loveshys rated themselves as being "fair" or "poor" at being happy, compared to <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men; 70 percent of the younger loveshys rated themselves as being "fair" to "poor" at being happy. The remainder of them checked "pretty good at being happy".</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men tended to attend motion pictures quite a bit more frequently than the non-shy men. Yet fully 100 percent of the older loveshys and 73 percent of the younger ones indicated that they usually try to avoid motion pictures that are classified as "light comedies". This was the case for <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the non-shy men. As I shall show in a later chapter, most of the loveshys wanted to be <i class="calibre4"> emotionally engrossed</i> while attending a motion picture. In contrast, the non-shys tended to be primarily interested in merely being entertained. Again, the non-shys could laugh easily at many different things; the loveshys, on the other hand, tended to find light comedies extremely boring and lacking in substance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite related to the natural and spontaneous ability to laugh (or cry), is the ability to display emotion generally. It is not at all unusual for American men to develop a trained incapacity for displaying emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the pathologically loveshy appear to have been especially vulnerable in this regard. For example, 93 percent of the older loveshy men along with 66 percent of the younger loveshys agreed that they found it very difficult to display emotion or feeling. Even among the non-shy men the analogous figure was a surprisingly high 19 percent—almost a fifth of those interviewed. Nevertheless, it seems quite apparent that an inability to be spontaneously real in one's interactions with others is a very central aspect of the loveshyness problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p450"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy 419</p>
<p class="calibre1">Control Over the Good and Bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men do not feel as though they enjoy any significant degree of control over the impressions other people have of them. I asked each man: "How much control do you think you have over the <i class="calibre4">good</i> things that happen to you in life?" And 100 percent of the non-shys thought that they enjoyed a good deal of control over what happened to them. In contrast, only 40 percent of the younger loveshys and just 27 percent of the older loveshys thought that they had any significant amount of control at all over the good things that happen to them in life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The story remained much the same when I asked: "How much control do you think you have over the <i class="calibre4"> bad</i> things that happen to you in life?" Only 6 percent of the older loveshys together with 25 percent of the younger loveshys thought that they had any control at all. In contrast, 73 percent of the non-shys thought that they had a substantial amount of control over the bad things that happen to them in life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, this 73 percent figure is a good deal lower than the 100</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent figure that applied to control over the <i class="calibre4"> good</i> things that happen in life. This would seem to reflect the fact that even non-shy, happy, well-adjusted people typically feel that they enjoy less control over the bad which might happen than over the good.</p>
<p class="scenebreak">. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Loneliness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The relationship between loneliness and loveshyness is more complex than most people imagine. I tested each of my respondents for loneliness through the use of a 20-item scale that had been developed at U.C.L.A. during the mid 1970s, by Dr. Letitia Anne Peplau. The scale together with the instructions for responding to it follows: For each of the following twenty statements please use the following legend:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"1" = I <i class="calibre4"> never</i> feel this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"2" </i> = I <i class="calibre4"> rarely</i> feel this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"3" = I <i class="calibre4"> sometimes</i> feel this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"4" = I <i class="calibre4"> often</i> feel this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Please <i class="calibre4"> circle</i> whatever number is closest to the truth for you for each of the twenty statements:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"></a>4 2 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. I am unhappy doing so many things alone. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. I have nobody to talk to. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. I cannot tolerate being so alone. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. I lack companionship. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. I feel as if nobody really understands me. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. I find myself waiting for people to call or write. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">7. There is no one I can turn to. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">8. I am no longer close to anyone. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">9. My interests and ideas are not shared by those around me. 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">10. I feel left out.  1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">11. I feel completely alone. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">12. I am unable to reach out and communicate with those around me. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">13. My social relationships are superficial. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">14. I feel starved for company. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">15. No one really knows me well. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">16. I feel isolated from others. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">17. I am unhappy being so withdrawn. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">18. It is difficult for me to make friends. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">19. I feel shut out and excluded by others. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">20. People are around me but not with me. 1 2 3 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">The mean (average) loneliness score for the 200 non-shy men was 27.4. The mean score for the 200 younger loveshy men was 60.9; and the mean score for the 100 older loveshy men was 73.2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, it would appear that the loveshy suffer from a great many more feelings of loneliness than do the non-shy. However, a problem with this interpretation is that 97 percent of the older loveshys together with 74 percent of the younger ones <i class="calibre4"> also claimed</i> (when I directly questioned them about it) that they <i class="calibre4"> never</i> experienced any feelings of loneliness <i class="calibre4"> for people of their own sex. </i> Simply put, the large majority of loveshy men do not seem to care about the fact that they do not have any real friendships with people of their own gender. Indeed, quite a few of the respondents specifically indicated that they did not even want any friendships with people of their own sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus it would appear that the twenty statements on <i class="calibre4"> Peplau's Loneliness Scale</i> were all interpreted by a majority of the loveshy males in strictly cross-sexed terms. It should be noted, of course, that the scale items are all <i class="calibre4"> gender-neutral. </i> In other words, none of the twenty statements have any bearing at all upon loneliness for the opposite sex as opposed to loneliness for one's own sex. Similarly, none of the items require an interpretation of loneliness for one's own sex as opposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy 421</p>
<p class="calibre1">loneliness for the opposite sex. Yet the loveshy men interviewed for this study all seemed to think strictly in terms of their long-term deprivation of cross-sexed companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, item #4 tended to be interpreted: "I lack opposite sexed companionship". Item #18 tended to be interpreted as: "It is difficult for me to make friends with the opposite sex". And so on for each of the other eighteen statements. In stark contrast, the non-shy men did not tend to think in these cross-sexed terms at all. Only the loveshy tended to interpret the scale exclusively in cross-sexed terms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man to respond to this statement: "It wouldn't bother me at all if I had no friends of my own sex. Just so long as I had friends of the opposite sex I'd be alright." Fully 86 percent of the older loveshys and 61 percent of the younger ones agreed with this statement. In contrast, only 12 percent of the self-confident non-shy men agreed with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell would I want a male friend for! All they ever talk about is baseball, basketball and football! I can't stand their interests or their crass, coarse manners. Whenever I even hear guys talk with each other I want to get away from them as fast as possible because it's too depressing. I want a girl! That's the only thing I've ever felt lonely for. I've never felt lonely for a male friend in my entire life!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(20-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the differences which obtained between the loveshys and the non-shys on the <i class="calibre4"> Peplau Loneliness Scale, </i> I got the distinct impression from my many interviews that loveshy males in general tend to have <i class="calibre4">a much weaker need for people</i> than (probably) the vast majority of the population of human beings. To be sure, the loveshys are far from content with their lot. But at the same time their needs for people tend to be restricted to their deeply felt need for just one (usually beautiful) opposite sexed person with whom they can love and live.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another impression I got (and I may be wrong about this one) is that the younger loveshys seem to suffer from a good many more bouts of really painful loneliness than the older loveshys do. The older loveshys seem to have adapted to their lot in life. And even though they are far from content with that lot or willing to accept it as their "just desserts", they do not appear to become bogged down by as many lengthy periods of debilitating depression as do the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh, twenty years ago there were sometimes weeks at a time when I couldn't even study or concentrate on any of my work. I would flunk courses I didn't have to flunk. Sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning I'd just be overwhelmed with an uncontrollable urge to just get up and take a really long walk. That used to happen a lot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p453"></a>422 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">of times. Every time I became infatuated with some girl at work or school I'd get this uncontrollable urge to take five-mile walks at any time of night, no matter how late. I'd be just so damned depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I'd be even more depressed if I just laid there. I just had to get up and run and run and run. And when I'd get back I'd be sapped of every ounce of energy, and still I'd be depressed—but I guess not as depressed as I would have been if I didn't run. I mean, I'd sometimes get these really beautiful fantasies when I'd take long walks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I'd see myself really making it with a beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It's been a really long time since I was that badly off. I guess I started to calm down when I was about 32 or 33. Right now I guess I feel more angry than depressed. Like I'm angry at society for depriving me of a chance for a wife and family simply because I'm shy. I mean that really pisses me off. And that's how I feel—pissed off, not depressed or even lonely so much." (47-year old loveshy man.) The foregoing feelings seemed to be quite typical of many of the older loveshy men. These feelings may merely be a reflection of changes in blood-androgens and blood-testosterones that gradually accrue as a person becomes older. Hence, blood hormone changes could affect certain emotional feelings (e.g., restlessness and depression) without causing any changes in basic beliefs concerning deprivation, being a long-term victim of unjust treatment, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, I would say that loveshyness is far from being in any way synonymous with loneliness. Loveshy males tend to think of "loneliness" strictly in terms of their long-term deprivation of meaningful, loving <i class="calibre4"> female</i> companionship. From this it can be concluded that membership in any kind of support group or friendship group that is strictly (or even primarily) male in membership composition is something that would drive most loveshy men to distraction. Therapists need to keep this point in mind. An all-male group almost invariably meets with strong feelings of resistance, boredom, disinterest, and even hostility, as far as loveshy men are concerned. They drop out of and avoid such groups because they do not perceive such group involvements as speaking in any way to their deeply felt needs and vested interests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, an all-male group will not in any way correct feelings of loneliness among loveshy men. It will not correct such feelings because involvement with male peers is not seen by loveshy men as being therapeutic. To the loveshy,  <i class="calibre4"> females</i> are the only human beings worth knowing or informally associating with. There is an old cliche that it is possible for a person to be quite "lonely" out in a crowd. Loveshy males characteristically <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> quite "lonely" when they are in or around groups of men. Never having developed the ability to truly "let their hair down"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p454"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy  4 2 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">and relax while in the company of men, they feel that only female companionship can accord them what they <i class="calibre4"> really</i> need.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Loneliness and Experimental Social Psychology</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Experimental work in the field of social psychology has led to a better understanding of the dynamics of loneliness. Much of this work has had a direct bearing upon the problem of loveshyness. And it is worth looking at in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A set of experiments by Schachter (1959) demonstrated that, given the opportunity, people confronting a stress-inducing experience will usually tend to seek out the informal social support of other people—</p>
<p class="calibre1">even strangers if necessary. Experimental subjects who thought they were going to experience a series of painful electric shocks, and subjects who anticipated experiencing only very mild electrical stimuli were given a choice between (1) waiting alone, and (2) waiting with other subjects for a brief period while final preparations were made for the experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, Schachter found that the greater the anticipated pain, the greater the tendency was for subjects to choose to wait amid the companionship of other people. He interpreted this pattern as reflecting heightened needs for reassurance, distraction, information, and social comparison, among subjects experiencing greater stress.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarnoff and Zimbardo (1961) largely replicated Schachter's results; but they also demonstrated the fact that people do not always seek social affiliation or emotional support in the face of severe stress or anticipated pain. These researchers distinguished between <i class="calibre4"> fear</i> of an inherently dangerous, painful external object, and <i class="calibre4"> anxiety, </i> the latter of which is negative emotional arousal <i class="calibre4"> that has no clear source</i> or which stems from <i class="calibre4"> objectively</i> <i class="calibre4">harmless objects or social situations. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to replicating Schachter's fear arousal conditions (anticipation of electric shock), their study also included an anxiety arousal condition in which male college students were led to anticipate having to suck on a variety of nipples, baby bottles and pacifiers—as in a contrived, embarrassing situation of the type which used to be televised as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"entertainment" on such television shows as CANDID CAMERA and PEOPLE ARE FUNNY.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, there was far greater variation among the experimental subjects in emotional arousal in the <i class="calibre4"> anxiety</i> condition than there had been in the <i class="calibre4"> fear</i> condition. More importantly, high levels of emotional arousal in the <i class="calibre4"> anxiety</i> condition led to a marked preference among the subjects for <i class="calibre4"> waiting alone</i> rather than with other subjects.  <i class="calibre4"> Almost all</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"></a>4 2 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjects in the <i class="calibre4"> fear</i> condition chose to wait for their anticipated ordeal amid the companionship of other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarnoff and Zimbardo suggest that if people are emotionally aroused for reasons that are largely idiosyncratic to their own unique personality or (possibly) not socially acceptable, they will tend to fear many kinds of informal social contact. And even potentially beneficial emotional support will only serve to increase their anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the <i class="calibre4"> anxious</i> person tends to be aware of the element of <i class="calibre4">inappropriateness</i> in his feelings, he is loath to communicate his anxieties to other people. To avoid being ridiculed or censured, he conceals anxiety aroused by stimuli which he guesses do not have a similar effect upon others and which, he feels, ought not to upset him. Thus when <i class="calibre4">anxiety</i> is aroused a person should tend to <i class="calibre4"> seek isolation from others. </i> On the other hand, when <i class="calibre4"> fear</i> is aroused and he is unable to flee from the threatening object, he welcomes the opportunity to affiliate with other people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy man (deep down) is clearly embarrassed about his inability to "connect" with any woman. Since women do not constitute an objectively dangerous sort of stimuli, the painful inability to approach and to initiate conversations with them represents an <i class="calibre4"> anxiety, </i> NOT a <i class="calibre4">fear. </i> In American society it is considered socially unacceptable for men (far more than is the case for women) to harbor anxieties. Indeed, it is considered even more socially unacceptable for men to permit their lives to be virtually <i class="calibre4"> governed</i> by their anxieties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The lives of the loveshy are, in point of fact, quite governed by their anxieties. And I believe that this represents a formidable reason as to why virtually none of the 300 severely loveshy men studied for this book had any strong desires to informally affiliate with members of his own gender. Many of the loveshy men specifically told me that <i class="calibre4"> once</i> <i class="calibre4">they managed to get themselves a girl</i> they would definitely want to have some male friends. But as long as they were without their heart's desire—</p>
<p class="calibre1">because of these socially unacceptable <i class="calibre4"> anxieties</i> which they were allowing to control their lives—they felt very uncomfortable whenever they were amid the informal companionship of fellow males whom they might have otherwise very much enjoyed having as friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This represents another reason why I believe that loveshy males of <i class="calibre4"> all</i> ages (including prepubescents) must <i class="calibre4"> first</i> be therapeutically helped to informally affiliate with women/girls. I believe that this <i class="calibre4"> must</i> be done <i class="calibre4">BEFORE</i> they will be in any way amenable to therapy aimed at the cultivation of same-sexed friendships. As long as (1) loveshy males desperately crave female companionship, and (2) as long as they are governed by these <i class="calibre4"> socially unacceptable anxieties</i> which cause them to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy 425</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunities for friendly, sociable self-assertion vis-a-vis women, they can be expected to go to considerable lengths to avoid sociable interaction with fellow males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another experimental study with clear implications for our understanding of loveshy males was conducted by Freedman and Doob (1968) at Stanford University. Using a clever experimental maneuver, they made some of their subjects feel <i class="calibre4"> "different" </i> from those around them, whereas other experimental subjects were made to feel "pretty much like others of their own age and sex." Hence, subjects who were told (after taking a battery of personality tests) that they were very unlike others of their age and sex <i class="calibre4"> tended to elect working alone</i> on a contrived experimental task.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This was especially true if none of the other experimental subjects in the room knew that they (the deviant subjects) were actually "deviant".</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, most of the experimental subjects run by Freedman and Doob chose to work in a group with other people. The only subjects who chose <i class="calibre4"> not</i> to work in a group with other people were either (1) those who had been made to feel "deviant" as a result of being shown fake personality test results that made them appear to be highly "deviant", and (2) those whose real or actual personality test profiles indicated that they were indeed (in reality) quite different from others of their age and sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men are, of course, quite demonstrably "deviant". How, indeed, could a <i class="calibre4"> totally virginal, </i> heterosexual man in his thirties or forties be anything but "deviant"! Most of the 300 loveshy men studied for this book were even more "deviant" than that, inasmuch as most of them had never even kissed (or been kissed) by a girl or woman! Many of them had never even dated. In this sense, severely loveshy men must be considered quite directly analogous to Freedman and Doob's</p>
<p class="calibre1">"unknown deviant" laboratory condition. Thus, you cannot spot a 40-year old male virgin on the street just by looking at him. You cannot spot a severely loveshy 19-year old male who has never been kissed, just by looking over a group of 19-year old individuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These "deviant" (involuntarily nonconformist) men tend to be quite embarrassed about their <i class="calibre4"> non-behavior, </i> about the fact that their "non-behavior" is at drastic variance with their value systems, and about the way their interpersonal anxiety vis-a-vis women has dominated and ruled over their lives. Thus, we might reasonably guess that most of them don't especially care to be "found out" or "exposed"—as could quite easily happen within the context of any all-male peer group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And, of course, many loveshy men further feel that the all-male peer group will misperceive them as "homosexuals". After all, how can 19-50 year old men who are totally without any form of heterosexual</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"></a>4 2 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience (and who are not priests) be anything but homosexual! That is the way popular lay-reasoning works. Most people are not even aware of the fact that about 40 percent of all homosexual men marry; about 35</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of them have children. And about 80 percent of them pass through a period of quite rampant <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> promiscuity before they finally come to terms with and accept their true homosexual identity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, homosexuality is a totally different "animal" from heterosexual loveshyness. Doubtless, there are some <i class="calibre4"> homosexual</i> loveshys. But they are most assuredly in the minority, just as <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> loveshys represent a small minority (1.5 percent) of all <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, people who feel "different" from others of their age and sex are highly unlikely to want to affiliate with friendship groups composed of same-sexed peers. Their desire to hide their deviancy until it is rectified will make them prefer aloneness to being in the company of others who might become hostile and disapproving. Of course, aloneness is not the same as true loneliness. Again, many of the loveshys studied for this book did not appear to suffer very frequently from true loneliness. Most of them preferred to be alone; and most of them tended to seek out solitude from those of their own gender. Unlike a truly lonely person, being "alone" did not usually make the loveshys feel depressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When they did feel depressed (or angry) it was because they lacked an intimate female companion, NOT because they did not have any friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, there appears to be some indication that even the depression that is caused by being without an opposite sexed intimate tends to dissipate somewhat with advancing age. The older loveshys <i class="calibre4">appeared</i> to be demonstrably less depressed than the younger loveshys—</p>
<p class="calibre1">despite the fact that their loneliness scores were higher than those of the younger loveshys. The older loveshys seemed to react to their plight primarily with feelings of anger, cynicism and fatalism. They appeared to be pretty well resigned to their plight, but nevertheless were very angry about it. The younger men appeared to be less cynical and less angry, but more prone to frequent bouts of painful depression-again, related exclusively to being without a girl friend,  <i class="calibre4"> never</i> to being without male friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because <i class="calibre4"> anxiety</i> does not entail any objectively dangerous stimuli, and because it is not warrented from a purely rational standpoint (society stipulates that men are "supposed to be" more <i class="calibre4"> rational</i> than women), loveshy men are basically "cowards" who cannot and will not help themselves by "taking the bull by the horns". They have "allowed" their emotions to overrule their rational intellects. Their anxiety state with respect to informal heterosexual involvement further makes them want to be alone in order to avoid the disapprobation of their own gender.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy  4 2 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Envy of Female Privilege</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The many conversations I had with the loveshy revealed a deep-seated attitude of envy towards female privilege. In most cases this envious attitude focused primarily upon the right of the female to be passive in male/female relationships, and to exercise <i class="calibre4"> control</i> over her life destiny simply by saying "no" to each male (and amorous advance) until the <i class="calibre4"> "right" </i> male (and amorous advance) came along. In essence, merely by <i class="calibre4"> playing the odds, </i> women could usually end up getting what they wanted simply by exercising <i class="calibre4"> negative control</i> vis-a-vis somebody else's <i class="calibre4"> (a</i> <i class="calibre4">male's)</i> assertive risk-taking. In not being able to work this way themselves, the loveshy men perceived themselves as second class citizens—</p>
<p class="calibre1">as "surplus refuge" whose feelings and needs society simply didn't care much about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And there were many other areas of life where envy of the female sex was evident. One young man told me about how his parents would not allow him to use a multi-colored umbrella he had purchased—because</p>
<p class="calibre1">"only females have a right to use pretty umbrellas." A few people mentioned hitchhiking, and the fact that a girl is usually picked up within two or three minutes, whereas a male will frequently have to wait for three or four hours. Another loveshy man who liked to sing recounted this story:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I got to high school one of the first things I did was to sign up for the chorus class. For some reason I was never shy about getting up to sing so long as I could do it before a large audience as part of a structured program, and not before some small group of people like a bunch of guys at somebody's house. Anyway, when I joined the class I was shocked out of my bloody wits. The teacher told me that I was a base, and he assigned me to sing base. I soon found out what base actually was—that it was the shit ugliest part of music—the garbage dump of the chorus. Well, I just didn't cooperate. I insisted on singing the beautiful notes that the composer wrote. They allowed the girls to sing the notes that the composer wrote. They call that soprano. But they give the boys the shit to sing just because they have the misfortune to be male.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, all the guys around me kept bullying me and punching me as I would be standing there singing the soprano part—which is the only decent and pretty part of a song. And they would be punching me, trying to get me to sing the shitty base along with them. Anyway, before the first concert the teacher threw me out of the class for refusal to cooperate. I mean this is just another illustration of how girls are treated as prima donnas while boys are always</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"></a>4 2 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">left to do the ugly dirt. It was just as well anyway because I didn't even like the kind of material we were required to sing. I like to sing the love ballads of Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter, and the like. All they had us sing was religious and patriotic garbage. I hate religious and patriotic music!" (21-year old loveshy man.) In essence, loveshy males often insist upon singing their own song and marching to their own drummer—quite in spite of their introverted tendencies. The above young man had been told that the base part contributes a countermelody that typically enables an audience to enjoy a choral piece better than they otherwise might. However, his feelings had been dominated by two major questions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Why should <i class="calibre4"> men</i> be discriminated against? Why should all men have to sing the ugly part simply because they are male, while all girls get to sing the pretty part just because they happen to be female? That is arbitrary and capricious discrimination against the male sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Singing base or even listening to it being sung removes all the joy from the activity of singing. The fact that the audience may enjoy it is quite beside the point.  <i class="calibre4"> I</i> have to enjoy what 7 am doing or else <i class="calibre4"> I</i> won't have anything to do with it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another major area wherein females were often bitterly envied had to do with the draft and the military. This subject will be dealt with in a later chapter. At this juncture suffice it to say that the loveshy feel that <i class="calibre4"> they are human beings too, </i> just as females are; and that males have emotions and feelings just as females do. Hence, the loveshy deeply resent the United States military treating males, but not females, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">"dispensable pawns", and forcing them to suffer severe physical pain and injury, and exposure to enormously anxiety-provoking situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They also resent the way military organizations endeavor to standardize male personalities, and the way they put males, but not females, through a host of degradation ceremonies—such as hair cutting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, there is the quite frequently recurring theme in the loveshys' conversations that males, unlike females, are <i class="calibre4"> "dispensable" and "surplus" </i>— <i class="calibre4">that they count for much less as human beings than females do; and that</i> <i class="calibre4">their feelings and emotional needs count for nothing. </i> I think these feelings are largely due to the deep-seated introspective tendencies that are endemic in highly inhibited, loveshy people. And they are undoubtedly also due to the heavy amount of bullying and mistreatment the loveshys had been forced to endure throughout all their years of growing up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been around, and I've never seen any girl bullied the way boys are bullied. Why shouldn't I be envious when all through life I've</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p460"></a>Some Psychological Characteristics of the LoveShy 429</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen males required to take all kinds of abuse just because they are males. Girls are treated in a far more humane way by everybody.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parents don't beat girls the way they do boys. At school it's always the boys who are getting it from the teachers. And the worst cruelty of all is what you have to take from people who should be your buddies." (19-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of my colleagues have suggested that loveshy males may have some latent transsexual tendencies. But none of the loveshys with whom I talked had any desire at all to have their genitalia removed so that they could become women. Of course, many of the loveshys did wish that they had been born female in the first place. But they did not wish to become women during their <i class="calibre4"> current</i> lifetime. Indeed, if by some stroke of magic the loveshys were suddenly transformed into women, they would <i class="calibre4"> all</i> remain highly attracted sexually (and in every other way) <i class="calibre4">to the female sex. </i> This is why I suggested in chapter five that severely loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> "male lesbians" </i> at heart. They are "closet heterosexual"</p>
<p class="calibre1">males who, even if they were women, would still want the love and the sexual attention of another <i class="calibre4"> woman, </i> and NOT of a man.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Chapter Postscript:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Johnny Carson "Tonight Show" of Thursday, December 6, 1984, Dr. Joyce Brothers appeared and presented a fascinating finding of relevance to this book. People with different native temperaments tend to prefer different types of <i class="calibre4"> fruit. </i> Asked to pick a fruit from a plentiful supply of different types, shy-inhibited people (who tend not to communicate much at all in purely social situations but who nonetheless tend to be highly dependable, loyal and potentially highly monogamous) tend to gravitate primarily or exclusively towards <i class="calibre4"> oranges, grapefruit, </i> and/</p>
<p class="calibre1">or <i class="calibre4"> pinapples. </i> In essence, a strong predilection towards citrus fruits over other types of fruits may reflect, from an early age in life onward, intractable shyness and behavioral inhibition. (It would not <i class="calibre4"> cause</i> these things; in essence, a preference for citrus over other types of fruits may <i class="calibre4"> reflect</i> these traits of temperament. Unfortunately, no questions dealing with fruit preferences were included in the research study upon which this book is based.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Appendix III of this book the reader will find a table which summarizes the mean <i class="calibre4"> Eysenck Personality Questionnaire</i> (EPQ) scores for the non-shy and for the loveshy samples. (A more detailed table can be found in Gilmartin, 1987—JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY article.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p461"></a>
<a id="p462"></a>Chapter 18</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Parenthood Aspirations</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast majority of the loveshy men expressed a desire to eventually have children of their own. Few of the older loveshys were optimistic about ever being able to achieve that desire. Nevertheless, 86</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 100 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4">did want</i> to procreate children of their own—if the fates would allow them to do so. Expressed somewhat differently,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the younger men interviewed for this book wished to go through life childless. There were no differences in this regard between the self-confident non-shy men and the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, there were <i class="calibre4"> big differences</i> between the loveshys and the non-shys when it came to the matter of gender preferences. I asked each man how many children of each sex he would eventually like to procreate, if his wishes could come true. And whereas 86 percent of the older loveshys would indeed like to have children, only 17 percent of them would like to have sons. Fully 69 percent of the older loveshys would want <i class="calibre4"> daughters only</i> if they had children. Again, 14 percent of the older loveshys preferred not to have any children at all, even if they somehow could manage to eventually get married.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The story was much the same for the younger loveshy men. Even though <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the younger loveshys would eventually like to have children, only 28 percent expressed any desire at all for sons. In essence, 72 percent would want their future wives to somehow procreate <i class="calibre4"> daughters only</i> for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the self-confident non-shy men had a quite different set of predilections. As a 200-person group, the non-shy men wished to procreate 145 sons for every 100 daughters. Most of them wanted to procreate children of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> sexes. But if they could have their way they would procreate almost three boys for every two girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The non-shy men also wanted larger families. Compared to the loveshy men, the non-shys seemed to be considerably less mindful of the social desirability of "zero population growth" and of the perils of the population explosion. In essence, the non-shy men registered a preference for an average of 2.63 children each. The younger loveshy men wanted 2.28 children each—a figure which would also contribute 4 3 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p463"></a>4 3 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">to uncontrolled population growth. Only the older loveshys wanted fewer than two children per family. Excluding the fourteen older loveshys who did not want to have any children at all, the remaining 86</p>
<p class="calibre1">older loveshy men wanted to have an average of 1.8 children per family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Expressed in more detailed terms, 50 percent of the non-shys wanted <i class="calibre4">three or more</i> children, compared to only 22 percent of the young loveshys, and just 5 percent of the older loveshys. None of the non-shy men wanted to have only one child. However, 7 percent of the younger loveshy men together with 22 percent of the older loveshys would be perfectly content with just one child. Those hoping to have two children included 50 percent of the non-shys, 71 percent of the younger loveshys, and 59 percent of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, it would appear that loveshy men tend to be quite normal in their desires to have children. Indeed, they might even be viewed as being a bit more socially responsible than the non-shys, inasmuch as they tended to desire somewhat smaller families than the latter. Quite clearly, loveshy men aspire to the goal of being able to enjoy a normal family life. The one thing which sharply distinguishes them from the non-shys is their overwhelming preference for daughters rather than sons. The large majority of the non-shy men wanted to eventually have both daughters and sons, with "two sons and one daughter" being the most commonplace preference pattern among them. In contrast, almost three-quarters of the loveshy men wanted daughters only. And some of them were quite adamant about this preference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I'll tell you. If the fates dictated that I had to have a son, I would definitely prefer not to have any children at all. Of course, if I really had my druthers I'd have two little girls. In fact, I even know what I would call them—Sarah and Jenny. That's what I really would like. But if I had to have a boy I would much rather not have any kids at all. Like I told you before, I just don't like boys. A boy is a horrible thing to be in this country. Boys are subjected to all kinds of indignity, and they're not accorded the respect that women are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They have to suffer a lot more than women. And in childhood they are either chastized and bullied all the time, or they are forced to take part in a lot of rough, boring games where people are likely to suffer a lot of pain and injury. There's no pleasure in that. But I think that having my little Sarah and Jenny would be just terrific—</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially if I could get a beautiful wife to go along with the bargain!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">(35-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would really love to be able to have children. But I gotta tell you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know what I would do if my wife gave birth to a son. I've always hated baseball, basketball and football. I don't like any of the things that boys are supposed to like. I just wouldn't be able to be any kind of a companion to a boy, unless he were like me. And Jesus Christ! In this lousy world we're living in I hope to God I wouldn't have a boy like me. I know I just wouldn't want to do that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p464"></a>Parenthood Aspirations  4 3 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">to anyone. I would never want anyone to have to suffer the kind of life I had to suffer when I was growing up. I know I'd much rather not have any children at all than have to deal with that. I would want my kids to be happy. And with me as their father, I don't see how that could come about unless they were girls." (24-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I don't like boys. In fact, I hate boys. I know because I was a boy myself. And a boy is a terrible thing to be in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes I think that the world would be a better place if everyone could somehow be a girl—if from now on no boys would ever be born again to anyone, and people had children by being artificially inseminated with only female sperm. There wouldn't be anymore war or bullying or cruelty. And there would be no more danger of a nuclear holocaust, and no more crime. The world would be a much safer place to live. And you could still make love. Everyone would be a lesbian, so there would still be a lot of sex. And the sex would be a lot better because there wouldn't be anymore violence and cruelty and rape." (22-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhhh, boys are dirty and aggressive. And I don't know how I'd handle one. I guess I'd have to leave the boy up to my wife, and I'd take care of the little girl. Have you ever noticed the fingers of little boys? Yuck! They're disgustingly filthy and sticky. The paws of my goddam dog are cleaner and more sanitary. Little girls can be kept clean. They are manageable, and you can sort of show them off. I mean you can dress them and take them out to different places and be proud of them." (37-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I like the theatre. In fact, everything that I really enjoy doing seems to be considered sort of feminine by people. I wouldn't have anything in common with a boy. I wouldn't know how to relate to one. I know I could relate very easily to a little girl. If I had daughters I know they would both grow up happy and well-adjusted. They would both be really wanted kids, and they would both be well taken care of. I don't know what I'd even name a son if I had one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've got the names of my daughters all picked out already. I decided several years ago that I'd call them Lisa and Becky. What would I call a boy?! Attila and Hitler are the only things I can think of—or maybe Fletcher, after my airedale—or maybe Stinky and Smelly! Ha Ha Ha!" (39-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even among the minority of loveshy men who <i class="calibre4"> did want</i> to have a boy (17 percent of the older loveshys and 28 percent of the younger ones), there was quite a bit of evident uneasiness about the prospect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Incidentally,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the loveshys wanting a boy had registered a preference for "one boy and one girl". And all of them seemed to be motivated by the desire for the opportunity to experience the idyllic old-fashioned, traditional type of family life with children of both sexes present in the home. In fact, consistent with this preference pattern several of these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p465"></a>4 3 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshy men indicated that they wanted the boy to be born first in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">"the boy should always be older than the girl".</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think I'd really like to have one boy and one girl. Yeah, I've done a lot of thinking about it, and that's what I want—only I want the boy to be born first. I think brothers and sisters get along better if the boy is the older one. And maybe they can introduce each other to boyfriends and girlfriends as they get older  . . . . The only thing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think I'd try to get my wife to assume primary responsibility for rearing my son. Like, you know, after all I've been through I wouldn't want to screw him up. Like I wouldn't want to take any chances, you know? I'd see if I could get my wife to let me have primary responsibility for the girl, and I'd let my wife deal with the boy all the time. Like I know I'd really like to have a son. But I'd sort of like to raise him from a distance—oh, I don't know how to express this—I don't know. I mean, I'd like to encourage my son and watch him grow. But I'd want to be sort of out of the picture—you know what I mean? The girl, if I had one, —well, I know I'd want to really spend a lot of time with my daughter. I mean I'd really want to be with her almost all the time. I'd want to take her places and do a lot of fun things with her. I don't know how I'll be able to do that without my son feeling sort of left out. But I'd get my wife to give my son a lot of love, and I'd encourage him to go out and play with his friends." (23-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know, I haven't given it much thought. But I think it would be sort of interesting to raise a son. It would be a neat experiment—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean with a guy like me as the father! I wouldn't be able to take him to any baseball games because I hate that stuff. But I'd take him to all the Broadway shows and movies, and I'd encourage him to study music. Like if he became really good at the trumpet or the saxophone, or even the piano, he could join a jazz band at his school and gain popularity that way. I don't know. I don't think there would be somebody like me born two generations in a row! I just know that my son would be a whole lot better off than I was! I just know it!" (38-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Fear of Discipline</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fears and anxieties pertinent to the taking of disciplinary action represent another very important reason for the loveshys' very strong predilections for female offspring. Girls are usually viewed as being easier than boys to discipline. They are widely viewed in American society as being the better behaved of the two genders. And they are viewed as being more responsive to discipline—especially to the gentler,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p466"></a>Parenthood Aspirations  4 3 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">milder forms of discipline. Of course, the self-fulfilling prophecy undoubtedly plays a role here. What people expect is ordinarily what they get!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, a key common denominator among loveshy men is that they want to do everything "gently". They want to have a "gentle"</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. Coping effectively with people or situations that "make waves" is much more difficult for loveshy people than for non-shy self-confident people. Further, the loveshys had no satisfactory past role models for effective parenting. They knew they wanted to reject the model posed by their own parents. But apart from ideas which they could get from reading books, they had no substitute role model with which to replace that which they had rejected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There can be no question that the loveshys' own sour memories of parent-child interaction served to dampen their enthusiasm for (1) handling parent-child discipline problems that are bound to develop in every family from time to time, and (2) for procreating <i class="calibre4"> male</i> offspring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy's own parents had not provided a benign or competent role model for managing tasks pertinent to social influence. Generally speaking, the most powerful social influence tends to be that which is least strongly perceived by the person (child) who is to be influenced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People (including children) tend to be easiest to influence when they are in a situation that they truly enjoy—a situation wherein they can let down their defensive guard. The reason why the peer group is such an effective source of influence for most children is that vis-a-vis its members a child usually feels free to "let down his/her hair" or defensive guard. The loveshys' parents tended to rely primarily upon coercive, belittling, ego-deflating disciplinary tactics. And unfortunately, most of the loveshys' homes had not been emotionally relaxing or enjoyable places in which to spend time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be perfectly frank about it, I know I'd never be able to discipline a boy. I'd have to leave everything up to my wife as far as discipline goes. I just wouldn't ever be able to deal with it. Just the mere thought of disciplining a boy child in any manner at all fills me with painful anxiety feelings. I don't know; I just don't feel that way about a little girl. I think I'd be able to deal with a little girl really well. I mean, I really feel confident about being a good parent to a little girl. I don't have any fears about that at all." (41-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">"What would you do if your son got real bratty? I couldn't handle that. I wouldn't even want to handle that. I mean I realize that girls sometimes do bad things too. But somehow I just don't feel nervous about dealing with that. I've had a really hard life up to now. And if I were able to have kids I'd want to create a nice, tension-free</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p467"></a>4 3 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment. Having a boy is like asking for trouble. I think I'd go to a doctor and see if I could get him to make sure that my wife and I only had girl children. Like if it were a boy it could be aborted; or it could be given up for adoption. I read where you can make $20,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">by giving up a child for adoption. If my wife were willing, that's what I'd want to do with a boy child." (47-year old loveshy man.) <b class="calibre3">Recycled Fathers</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, the only other group of American males, apart from the loveshy that has been found to have a strong preference for procreating female offspring, is that of recycled fathers. A <i class="calibre4"> "recycled father" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">is a man who had already raised one family. Now that he is in his 40s or 50s and newly remarried to a second wife who is likely to be as much as two or more decades his junior, he decides to procreate a second crop of children. He is especially likely to want to do this because his young wife has never procreated children of her own.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Men who become fathers in their 40s or 50s seldom want to have anything more to do with little league baseball and football, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In that regard their feelings tend to be very similar to those of loveshy males of all ages. Thus, they want to procreate female children because it is easier and more relaxing to raise a girl—and because far fewer things can go wrong in raising a girl than in raising a boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Selecting the Gender of One's Future Children</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the benefit of loveshy readers, there are three different approaches which can be used for selecting the gender of one's future child. To be sure, many people object to the idea of allowing husbands and wives to exercise control over this area. However, my own research has convinced me that a good 85 percent of all American husbands and wives either (1) do not wish to exercise such control, or (2) they are insufficiently motivated for going to the trouble of doing so. Hence, there is little reason for moralists to become alarmed here. With only 10</p>
<p class="calibre1">or 15 percent of married couples exercising control over the selection of their children's genders, it is doubtful whether society's sex ratio would be affected to any significant extent. Remember, most people want more sons than daughters. The loveshy represent the <i class="calibre4"> very opposite</i> of this predilection, thus giving society some much needed female children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything else being equal, it is quite reasonable to expect that having children of the desired sex would increase the probability of high quality,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p468"></a>Parenthood Aspirations  4 3 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">competent parenting. And that would benefit everyone, child as well as parent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most widely used technique today for choosing one's baby's sex is simply <i class="calibre4"> amniocentesis combined with abortion. </i> This method has been available only since the mid-1970s. And it involves having an appropriately qualified physician test the amniotic fluid surrounding the growing fetus. This is a procedure which can be accomplished quite early in pregnancy. And besides enabling the prospective parents to learn of the presence of certain genetic abnormalities, it also permits the ascertaining of whether the fetus is a male or a female.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most (but certainly far from all) physicians consider it unethical to abort a healthy <i class="calibre4"> female</i> fetus simply because the parents wish to have a boy. However, it is comparatively easy to get a physician to abort a <i class="calibre4"> male</i> fetus because the parents desire a female child. Again, the widespread desire that most people have for procreating boy babies renders most physicians rather squeamish about aborting female fetuses for gender selection purposes—unless the pregnant mother already has three or four daughters and wishes for her final child to be a son. Inasmuch as a very strong need for female children is far more unusual than a very strong preference for male children, the loveshy should encounter comparatively little difficulty in locating physicians willing to abort their wives' male fetuses—provided that their wives are also uncomfortable about the idea of procreating a male child.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, one out of every twenty-three men manufactures only one kind of sperm. A man who is biologically capable of synthesizing <i class="calibre4"> only</i> androsperms (male sperm) would have to resort to some form of artificial insemination <i class="calibre4"> via a donor</i> if he and his wife were strongly intent upon having a female child. Of course, most men can simply "try again", and hope that with the second try the fetus will be female.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">PreSelecting Prior to Conception a Baby's Sex</i> There is an easy-to-learn technique which can increase up to <i class="calibre4"> about</i> <i class="calibre4">60 percent</i> the probability of having female offspring. This technique has been developed and thoroughly researched by Dr. Elizabeth Whelan of the Harvard University Medical School. And it involves the timing of sexual intercourse relative to the moment of ovulation. Interested readers will find a readable and quite fascinating account of this procedure contained in a paperback book entitled BOY OR GIRL? By Dr. Whelan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In view of the large amount of ongoing research pertinent to the issue of preselecting a baby's sex, it now seems likely that by the year 1995 a foolproof, 100 percent effective means will be available to anyone who wishes to employ it. In all probability this method will entail taking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p469"></a>4 3 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pill which will kill off all of the androsperms (boy sperms)—assuming that one wishes to procreate a female child. However, at the moment prospective parents desirous of having a female child can only increase the odds in their favor from the original 50-50 provided us by mother nature, to 60-40. (Those interested in having a <i class="calibre4"> male</i> child can increase <i class="calibre4">their</i> odds to 68-32 by following Dr. Whelan's directions.) In order to preselect a baby's sex it is necessary for the wife to keep detailed records of her menstrual cycles over a period of some six to eight months. Towards this purpose a fertility kit should be purchased from a drug store. This will contain a special, detailed thermometer and a spool of tes-tape. The main objective is for the wife to be able to predict with a high level of accuracy the time when during any given cycle she will ovulate. And she will be able to achieve a high level of predictive accuracy through (1) regular use of the thermometer each morning immediately upon awakening, (2) testing cervical mucous for the dates upon which it is most elastic, slippery and clear, and (3) use of the tes-tape, which is a special kind of litmus paper that is capable of responding color-wise to chemical changes in the cervix.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, couples desirous of a <i class="calibre4"> girl baby</i> should be sure to copulate within about a day and a half <i class="calibre4"> prior to</i> the moment of anticipated ovulation. And during the crucial copulation sexual intercourse should be preceded by an acid douche consisting of two tablespoons of white vinegar to a quart of water. The wife should try to inhibit herself from experiencing orgasm during the crucial (girl baby-making) copulation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, those wishing to have a girl need not abstain from sexual intercourse during the first half of the cycle. In fact, a low sperm count slightly increases the probability of female offspring. So frequent intercourse prior to the crucial copulation one day prior to ovulation will prove beneficial. But it should not be any more frequent than once every two days. Daily intercourse would render the sperm count too low for fertilization to be likely.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Eugen Jonas Method</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The third approach for selecting the gender of one's future child is an astrological one devised by Czechoslovakian physician Dr. Eugen Jonas. Using this approach on some 35,000 female patients over a 30</p>
<p class="calibre1">year period, Jonas claims a 90 percent success rate for it. No one knows exactly how or why it works. And as author of this book I would recommend caution in its use. The Whalen technique <i class="calibre4"> may</i> be more reliable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, for those who might be interested in trying out the astrological approach, here is a very brief, capsule summary as to how to do it:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p470"></a>Parenthood Aspirations  4 3 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Have a trained astrologer draw up a natal horoscope <i class="calibre4"> for the wife. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The chart should be accurate <i class="calibre4"> to the nearest minute. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">2. </i> Ascertain the number of degrees and minutes separating the wife's natal Sun from her natal Moon. This should be done by moving <i class="calibre4"> counterclockwise</i> from the position of the Sun to the position of the Moon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Get a detailed ephemeris (from a bookstore or library) for the current month and year. Then find the day during the wife's current menstrual cycle during which the Sun and the Moon will be the <i class="calibre4"> same number of degrees apart from each other</i> as they had been at the moment she was born. Using an ephemeris for the current month, this will be very easy to calculate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. The day <i class="calibre4"> during each menstrual cycle</i> when the Sun and Moon are the same number of degrees apart from each other as they had been at the moment of the wife's birth is the <i class="calibre4"> wife's most fertile</i> <i class="calibre4">day for that cycle. </i> Pregnancy would be most likely to occur on that day.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Using your ephemeris, notice what sign the Moon is in during that day. If the Moon is in (1) Taurus, (2) Cancer, (3) Virgo, (4) Scorpio, (5) Capricorn, or (6) Pisces, your wife will conceive a <i class="calibre4"> girl</i> if you can get her pregnant on that day. If the Moon is in any of the other six signs,  <i class="calibre4"> don't have intercourse</i> because if you do and your wife becomes pregnant, she will have a boy.  <i class="calibre4"> (Note:</i> The Moon changes signs every 2.4 days; so one-third of the time you will have to calculate just exactly where, in terms of sign, the Moon is during the portion of the day when you are having sexual intercourse.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shyness and Contracepting</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have shown, loveshy men tend to <i class="calibre4"> prefer</i> smaller families than non-shy men. However, if the loveshy were to actually become actively involved in regular sexual intercourse, they might actually end up fathering <i class="calibre4"> more</i> rather than fewer children than the non-shy men! For example, I asked each man: "Would you be too shy to ask the clerk in a drug store for a package of condoms or vaginal foam?" And fully 97 percent of the older loveshy men together with 87 percent of the younger ones said <i class="calibre4"> "yes", </i> they <i class="calibre4"> would</i> be too shy! Only 6 percent of the non-shy men indicated that they were "too shy" to purchase a package of condoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lee Rainwater, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis, has extensively studied the fertility behavior of working-class midwes-terners. And one of his strongest and most consistent findings has been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p471"></a>4 4 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">that men with inhibitions pertinent to self-disclosure and to sexuality tend to have much larger families than more sociable, socially self-confident men. He points out that many husbands remain quite shy vis-a-vis their wives, even after several years of marriage. These husbands never discuss with their wives their own most deeply held feelings; and they do little to make their wives feel comfortable about discussing intimate needs and feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Use of any form of contraception or birth control necessarily entails some discussion between husband and wife. Because inhibited men feel very uncomfortable about such discussions, contraceptive responsibility is left entirely up to the wife. And since the wives who are married to such men are themselves quite often ill at ease on matters pertinent to sexuality, they too are usually not especially prone towards the taking of any contraceptive precautions. Thus, even in the area of family planning, the loveshy may be disinclined towards taking over the "driver's seat" of their own lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Technically, in order to successfully practice astrological birth control you must abstain from sexual intercourse on the date of the wife's natal sun-moon alignment, as well as on the three days preceeding that date. The best day for having sex if you wish to maximize your chances for pregnancy is the date immediately before (one day prior to) the date of the wife's natal sun-moon alignment. The sex of the baby to be conceived will be determined by the moon's position on the date of the wife's natal sun-moon alignment during her <i class="calibre4"> current</i> menstrual cycle. Thus, if the moon is in an even numbered sign when she conceives, the baby will be a girl; otherwise it will be a boy.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Career, Money, Education, and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most psychologists today agree that there are essentially two avenues to happiness, effectiveness, and constructive productivity as a human being. In his book THE ART OF LOVING, Erich Fromm called these <i class="calibre4"> creative work</i> and <i class="calibre4"> creative love. </i> All people need to become involved in networks of roles and social relationships in both love and work that are meaningful and important to them. To the extent that a person loses or is deprived of the ability to travel with reasonable harmony along either the "love avenue" or the "work avenue", he is likely to be headed for trouble. Both love and work appear to be quite necessary, especially for men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this chapter is to review the data that were obtained on matters pertinent to career, money and education. The 200 younger loveshys and the 200 non-shys were all college and university students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As all 400 of these men were between the ages of 19 and 24 at the time the interviews were conducted, I did not pay much attention to their social class backgrounds. Of course, time will determine what each of these men actually does with the education that he gets. There was no way of determining at the time of the interviews just how successful the 19 to 24 year olds would eventually become.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it can be said that all of the non-shys and younger loveshys came from middle-class to upper-middle-class homes. Most of them had grown up in suburban areas of the major metropolitan areas of New York and Los Angeles. And over 90 percent of them had resided throughout most of their formative years in single family houses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The demographic characteristics of the 100 older loveshy men were in several important respects quite amazing and noteworthy. Unfortunately, at this time there is no way whereby the <i class="calibre4"> representativeness</i> of these 100 older loveshys can be accurately ascertained. Nevertheless, the following characteristics of these men stand out and are worth noting: 4 4 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p473"></a>442</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Level of Attained Education</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 93 percent of the older loveshys had completed an undergraduate B.A. or B.S. degree. Only 24 of these 93 men had completed their degrees in practical, career-related disciplines such as business, engineering, and computer programming. The remainder had majored in liberal arts, social science and humanities discipline. Majors in philosophy, art, psychology, sociology, education, history, geography, theatre arts, creative writing, and English and American literature, were the most prevalent in the backgrounds of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> the older and the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time they were interviewed, only 31 percent of the younger loveshys were majoring in fields related to business, engineering, or computer programming. Fully 62 percent of them were majoring in liberal arts, social science, humanities and education related disciplines; and 7 percent of them were still "undecided" as to a major. In contrast, only 23 percent of the non-shy men were majoring in liberal arts, social science and humanities disciplines; and only 3 percent were in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"undecided" category. The remaining 74 percent were all majoring in career-related disciplines of a traditionally masculine nature, such as business, engineering, architecture, computer programming, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding education beyond the undergraduate level, 42 percent of the older loveshy men had completed at least one graduate degree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five of the older loveshys had completed an M.B.A. (masters degree in business administration), whereas another 6 percent had completed a masters degree in an engineering discipline. The remaining 31 men had completed their masters degrees in liberal arts, social science or humanities disciplines. In addition, there were three Ph.D.s in the sample; and all three of these men had earned their advanced educations in liberal arts disciplines.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Unemployment and Underemployment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 16 percent of the older loveshys were unemployed at the time they were interviewed. And another 9 percent were employed on only a part-time basis because they were unable to find a full-time job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These statistics are quite noteworthy because as of the year 1982, only 3.6 percent of white, college educated men were unemployed. In essence, the loveshy appear to be extremely prone towards unemployment, prolonged underemployment, and/or part-time employment.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p474"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 4 3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Annual Incomes</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The average annual income for the older loveshys was only $14,782</p>
<p class="calibre1">(data obtained 1979-1981). Given the fact that 93 percent of these loveshys had completed an undergraduate degree and 42 percent of them had completed at least one graduate degree, it clearly follows that these men represent a significantly <i class="calibre4"> underrewarded</i> and ignored segment of the American population.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The average annual income of the 24 older loveshys who had completed at least one degree in business, computer science or engineering, was $21,163. Of course, this figure is still well below what would normally be expected for a group of university-educated 35 to 50 year old men. But it is also quite clearly superior to what the majority of the older loveshys were achieving from a financial standpoint. This represents a major reason why severely loveshy men probably need to exercise better care than most people in the managing of their educational preparation. For severely loveshy men it would appear that <i class="calibre4"> amount</i> of education is of substantially less importance than <i class="calibre4"> substantive content</i> of education. For example, the average annual income for the 31 older loveshys with <i class="calibre4"> graduate degrees</i> in the liberal arts, social sciences and humanities, was only $16,912-a figure still substantially lower than the $21,163 which loveshys with a B.S. degree in business or engineering were getting.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Places of Abode</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">All of the 100 older loveshy men were residing in small rented apartments at the time the interviews were conducted. In fact, many of them were living in one-room bachelor apartments. And even though I as the author of this study was the only judge, I would say that only 27 percent of these men were living amidst what could reasonably be considered "pleasant surroundings". For the most part the apartment buildings were located in less-than-attractive neighborhoods. Most of the buildings were quite old. And the living quarters themselves tended to be quite cramped and cluttered.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Childhood Socioeconomic Status</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Judging by questions pertinent to (1) occupation of the father, (2) neighborhood of residence while growing up, and (3) type of housing while growing up, it seems quite reasonable to conclude that the older</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p475"></a>444</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">loveshys had become <i class="calibre4"> downwardly mobile. </i> Fully 92 percent of the older loveshys had grown up in private, single-family houses which were located in attractive suburban neighborhoods. And virtually all of their fathers had held middle to upper-middle-class occupations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, it would appear that the outstanding educational backgrounds of the older loveshy men were not sufficient to compensate for deficits in social self-confidence and in interpersonal finesse. Sociologists typically use the term <i class="calibre4"> "status inconsistent" </i> to describe the general life style of people whose educations far surpass their incomes and occupational prestige levels. "Status inconsistents" are seldom happy, content, or productive. And the life situations of the older loveshy men well illustrate this point.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Implications of Money for LoveShyness</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Money has always been a great aphrodisiac. With some exceptions men who have a comfortable amount of it are much more likely than the financially less comfortable to feel good about themselves. They are also more likely to feel in control of things. They are more likely to feel as though they are in the "driver's seat" of their own lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so there is evidence of another vicious cycle operating here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness appears to be a cause (in conjunction with a non-technical education) of low income and of career instability. Indeed, it appears quite evident that low income and career instability both serve to aggravate and to exacerbate loveshyness problems. Both render the loveshy less and less self-confident about even the mere thought of making the first move vis-a-vis a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has often been said that <i class="calibre4"> "a man's career is his penis". </i> Because of differential gender role socialization, a man's very sense of personal identity is likely to be wrapped up in what he does for a living, to a considerably greater extent than what is the case for most women. Further, having only enough money to "get by" is itself hardly conducive to a free attitude towards spending, "letting go" and having fun. Worry and concern over "having enough" can render even a non-shy person considerably less self-confident in the company of women than he ordinarily would be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sociological research data have demonstrated again and again that the chances for a successful "pursuit of happiness" vary a great deal as a function of <i class="calibre4"> income. </i> In a 1977 national survey that asked people how happy they were, 46 percent of them with family incomes over $20,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">said that they were "very happy". The proportion of "very happy"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p476"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 4 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">people dropped to 33 percent for the $10,000 to $19,999 income range, and to 29 percent among people whose annual incomes were below $10,000.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, even when it is considered by itself apart from other variables, income wields a formidable impact upon happiness, contentment, and overall self-esteem. With only enough money to "get by", the alternative courses of action available to people become severely restricted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially for men with loveshyness problems, self-confidence vis-avis the opposite sex is bound to be adversely impacted upon to at least some extent. After all, it is the man who is supposed to (in our society) do the paying, the wining and dining,  <i class="calibre4"> and the impressing. </i> Not having the funds is likely to make it all the more difficult, especially for older loveshy men, to begin taking constructive action.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Shyness in the Job Search</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness does not exist in a vacuum. Men who are severely loveshy are quite likely to be unusually shy in other important areas of life as well. Many of the (1) skills, and (2) states of mind, that are requisite to success in winning meaningful female companionship are <i class="calibre4"> also</i> requisites for success in the world of employment. For example, let's consider the attitude of the loveshy towards the risk-taking enterprise of searching out a good job opportunity in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man: "How shy would you be about telephoning an executive about an <i class="calibre4"> advertised</i> job opening? Assume that the executive's name is given in the job ad."  <i class="calibre4"> None</i> of the non-shy men indicated any shyness at all here. In contrast, fully 63 percent of the older loveshys and 52 percent of the younger ones indicated that they would be shy about making the telephone call. It should be noted, of course, that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the older loveshys had been out in the workaday world for at least ten or more years. Thus, the 63 percent figure must be considered quite shockingly high.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 36-year old M.B.A. holder from California State University at Fullerton, worked as a $15,000 per year clerk in an insurance firm. He had held this position for almost four years despite his conspicuous overqualification for it. The following represents a quote from one of my interviews with him:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I first got out of school I made really good money for awhile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the tensions on the job were just getting to be too much for me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They were asking me to do a lot of things I just didn't have the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p477"></a>4 4 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">nerve to do. And I think some of the guys who worked in my department thought I was snubbing them. Anyway, I heard that they had gone to the boss and they succeeded in getting me fired.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess I wasn't too friendly. But I just haven't got the gaul to be friendly. I mean it takes a tremendous amount of nerve to be friendly with people. You know—I'd see the guys in the restroom. And what else could I say to them but 'hi'?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, I managed to get two other good jobs since then. One of them I got through an employment agency. Fortunately I didn't have to pay anything for the job because I only lasted three months on it. I mean they were asking me to do all sorts of things that just made me too nervous. Like I was always being asked to call people up on the telephone. And one time they even asked me to invite a customer out for lunch. I had to refuse because I just haven't got the nerve to do something like that. They never taught us anything like that in my graduate school of business. You might not believe it, but I was always a good student!</p>
<p class="calibre1">After I lost this job five years ago I just began to feel that the job search just wasn't worth it. I mean it just made me too damned nervous. I would come home each day a nervous wreck, and I couldn't sleep each night worrying about what I would say to this employer or that employer the next day. The people I was supposed to hit it off with were all just too outgoing for me, and I knew that no matter what my resume said or how good my grades at school were, they just didn't like me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So one day this employment agency referred me to this insurance job. They told me that if I performed well I'd eventually make a good salary. But the raises so far only amount to about $500 a year before taxes. So I don't like the money too much. But at least I don't have to worry about anxiety-provoking situations all the time. I guess I am in a bit of a rut. But I just haven't got the nerve to look for something else—at least not now. Anyway, what would I tell my supervisor if I had to cut out in the middle of the day for some job interview somewhere? I just wouldn't have the nerve to tell my supervisor that I was on the lookout for a better job opportunity."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding this last point, several of the older loveshys talked about how they had just walked out of certain jobs without giving their employer any notice, because they "just didn't have the nerve to tell their employer that they wanted to quit." Two men advised me that at 5 o'clock on the last day they wanted to work for an employer they dropped a letter in the mailbox advising the employer that they were quitting and that they would not be back. Hence, it should be easy for the reader to appreciate why many of these men were not well-liked at their former places of employment!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p478"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 4 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Unadvertised Job</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is an established fact that only 25 to 30 percent of the best jobs and career opportunities are advertised. The large majority of the most desirable positions (some 70 percent or so) are obtained through informal social networks. People can very effectively tap into these informal friendship networks (1) by contacting their own and their parents' friends and relatives, and (2) by contacting executives in the fields of their choice, and asking these executives for a few minutes of their time. These meetings are technically called <i class="calibre4"> "advice calls" </i> as opposed to "employment interviews" because the job seeker is neither responding to a job ad nor asking for a job. In essence, he is merely asking for advice and for personal names of appropriate executives with whom it might prove productive to talk. Simply put, the key purpose of an "advice call" is to try to plug into an influential executive's social network.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such personal meetings are usually solicited by telephone. And the task of obtaining the interviews and going through them effectively requires some degree of poise, "nerve", and relaxed, natural friendliness. Most loveshy men are seriously lacking in these attributes. And as such they are deprived of the route to most of the best employment opportunities. For example, I asked each man:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"How shy would you feel about telephoning a major executive of a company and asking him about the possibility of any job openings developing in his department in the near future? Please assume that you are not responding to a job ad; you simply want to discuss possible opportunities with this major executive. How shy would you be about doing this?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 100 percent of the older loveshy men indicated that they would be too shy to do this. Among the younger loveshys 79 percent thought that they would be too shy to try it. In contrast, only 12 percent of the non-shys thought that they would be "more than moderately shy"</p>
<p class="calibre1">about making such a telephone call. And parenthetically, all of even this 12 percent indicated that they would go ahead and do it anyway quite irrespective of their nervousness about the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final example, I asked each man: "How shy would you feel about walking in unannounced on an executive in order to discuss with him possible job opportunities that have not been advertised?" Several of the loveshy men insisted that this shouldn't even be tried—that it was "discourteous" and simply "not done". Of course, research shows that it is done a very great deal by the most successful job seekers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The results indicated that fully 100 percent of the older loveshys together with 82 percent of the younger ones felt that there was no way</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p479"></a>4 4 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">they could ever possibly do such a thing. In contrast, only 27 percent of the self-confident non-shys indicated that they would be shy about the matter. In addition, only 5 percent of the non-shy men indicated</p>
<p class="calibre1">: that they would definitely rule out doing it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nowadays all major American cities have a number of so-called</p>
<p class="calibre1">"executive search services". These organizations are not employment agencies because they do not place people or solicit job openings from area companies. In fact, it would be illegal for them to do so in that a license is required for operating an employment agency. Executive search services do not have this license. They earn their money by acting as a consultant to the man or woman  w h o is in search of a better career opportunity. Their fees are high, ranging from a low of $1,500 to a high of $3,000.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Four of the older loveshy men had done business with such firms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following interview excerpt amply demonstrates the severe and costly problems that loveshyness creates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"As you know, I have a Masters degree in European history. And there just isn't any way of getting a job with that type of background.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I had always wanted to teach in a junior college or in a high school somewhere. But nobody wants history teachers anymore. I had been driving a cab for over two years and I was really tired of it because here in Los Angeles it's so damned dangerous, and you have to work six nights a week in order to even get by financially.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I saw this ad in the LOS ANGELES TIMES about how a $20,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">a year job could be guaranteed to educated but underemployed people. I went to the address indicated and was subjected to this really well polished sales spiel. I remember the offices there were incredibly plush, and the people were so friendly. Anyway, they were so convincing that I invested $1,800 of my hard-earned dollars on the spot. Since my shift at the cab company is from 4 PM to 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">AM, I thought I could easily do whatever they wanted me to and still earn the money I needed to get by.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I want to tell you I was really very deeply disappointed by what happened. I think that was the blackest time of my entire life because they were asking me to do all kinds of stuff I just didn't have the nerve to do. I tried to get my money back. I mean I contacted the Better Business Bureau, the Legal Aid Bureau, some of the consumer protection and consumer fraud groups, and a whole bunch of other places. But all I could get was their sympathy. They couldn't do anything for me because of the fine print in the contract I had signed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This executive search place had all kinds of testimonial letters from people boasting of the terrific jobs they had been able to get with the help of this company's service. But they make you go out on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p480"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy 449</p>
<p class="calibre1">these advice calls. You have to contact a lot of people all the time, cold. Like I always thought of commission selling as the cruelest, most horrible job in the world outside of wartime combat itself. Well, this stuff they were asking me to do was just as impossible for me as a commission selling type of job would be. The only people they will ever really help are those with no anxiety feelings. You know, like insensitive people who have no qualms about approaching strangers cold. I mean if anybody is <i class="calibre4"> that</i> nervy, why don't they just take some selling job and save themselves $1,800! I don't know! This whole damn world is just a cruddy, cruel place!" (46-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Shyness On the Job</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as severe shyness effectively obviates an effective job search, it also greatly interferes with certain facets of on-the-job performance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, I asked each respondent the following question: "You feel that you have been performing well in your occupation; but it has been over a year since you received your last raise. How shy would you feel about approaching the supervisor and discussing the matter with him?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 94 percent of the non-shy men replied that they would <i class="calibre4"> not</i> feel shy at all about doing this. In contrast, only 17 percent of the younger loveshy men and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older loveshys felt that they could approach the supervisor about the matter without feeling painfully shy about doing so. In addition, 86 percent of the older loveshys together with 68 percent of the younger loveshys felt that they would be "very shy" to "extremely shy" about approaching the supervisor and asking about the possibility of a raise. None of the non-shy men felt this shy about the idea of asking for a raise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, in response to a question about whether or not they would <i class="calibre4">actually</i> indeed ask for a raise if a situation similar to the above happened to them, 89 percent of the non-shy men said that they "definitely would", compared to only 33 percent of the younger loveshys and just 19 percent of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following scenario also revealed quite substantial differences between the loveshys and the non-shys: "A colleague who has been goofing off a good deal gets a raise and a promotion while your efforts on behalf of the company have apparently gone unnoticed. How shy would you feel about discussing your feelings with your supervisor?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 100 percent of the non-shys said that they would be "quite confident and self-assured" about doing this. Only 41 percent of the younger loveshys and 24 percent of the older ones similarly felt any degree of self-confidence at all about discussing the matter with the supervisor.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p481"></a>4 5 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shyness in employment situations seems to entail many other problems as well. For example, loveshy men are often too shy to attend to certain tasks that are a part of many jobs. Many of them are too shy to use the telephone. And virtually all of them are too shy to use the telephone if the task has anything at all to do with selling, with collecting, or with the filing of any complaints. Many forms of informal face-to-face socializing that are required by many jobs are similarly beyond the ken of most severely loveshy men. And, of course, several of the loveshys interviewed for this book had gotten themselves into serious trouble at work because of their inability to stop staring at certain attractive women. Indeed, some of the men had been fired for such staring (unintentional harassing of women).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further examples need not be given. Clearly, loveshy men possess too much "thin skin" and hypersensitivity for effective success-striving and competitiveness in today's business world. Indeed, the foregoing discussion should provide incisive support for the view that a university education in intellectual skills and technical knowledge only will often lead to a life of career failure and underachievement—particularly as far as the loveshy are concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Employment Attitudes</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the questionnaire items employed for this research are of particular relevance to the issue of employment success and effectiveness. For illustrative purposes, I shall present nine of these items together with the obtained percentage results. There is no need for any com-mentary here. The following data provide a poignant and forceful argument to the effect that loveshyness and employment ineffectiveness are both caused by some of the same deficits of personality. Thus, if you either cure or prevent loveshyness, you necessarily at the same time cure or prevent many forms of employment ineffectiveness and underachievement.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Some Positive Recommendations</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The experience of interviewing hundreds of people has convinced me that there are certain steps which the loveshy can take that will minimize the difficulties they are likely to encounter in the employment sector of life. The recommendations that I shall make here are applicable primarily to young people who are still in school. Parents, teachers and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p483"></a>4 5 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">advisors of loveshy men will be able to be of especial service to their charges if they reflect carefully upon the following points.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, loveshy boys and young men need clearly established,  <i class="calibre4"> realistic career goals. </i> And the earlier in life they are able to commit themselves to these goals, the better off they are likely to be. It is not enough that the loveshy be able to visualize themselves in the mind's eye attaining these goals, although that is important. What is <i class="calibre4"> most important</i> is that these goals, once attained, permit the successful pursual of a career path which is lifelong and which permits <i class="calibre4"> stability. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the older loveshys who were interviewed for this book, few had given any serious thought to what kind of work they would engage in as adults. And the younger loveshys were scarcely any better off in this regard. Most of both groups of loveshy men had labored under the false and misleading notion that if they merely completed a university degree in something, they would be alright. Indeed, the sad-dest cases of all entailed men who had assumed that if they successfully completed an M.S., M.A., or a Ph.D., they would just naturally be alright.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have documented throughout this book, the loveshy tend to follow the law of least resistance in almost everything they do. And this is doubtless a key reason why they experience so many stumbling blocks in arriving at some semblance of success and happiness. Career-wise, the first mistake most of them make is in their choice of an <i class="calibre4"> academic</i> <i class="calibre4">major. </i> Here the loveshy veer toward those fields which are (1) most interesting to them, and (2) which are easiest for them to accumulate an impressive grade-point average.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A cardinal rule which all loveshy men should memorize before they even set foot in a college or university is this: THE CHOICE OF A MAJOR IS OF INFINITELY GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN GRADE-POINT AVERAGE. To put it bluntly, A STRAIGHT <i class="calibre4"> "C" </i> AVERAGE IN</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE <i class="calibre4"> RIGHT DISCIPLINE</i> WILL BE OF VASTLY GREATER VALUE TO</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE LOVESHY THAN A STRAIGHT <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> AVERAGE IN THE <i class="calibre4"> WRONG</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">DISCIPLINE. Good grades can be helpful. But the <i class="calibre4"> courses</i> in which such grades are earned is a matter of far greater importance than the good grades themselves. Completion of a major in a technical field with only a <i class="calibre4"> "C" </i> average will very likely get a loveshy man a much better career opportunity than will an <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> average in a non-technical discipline that is not clearly related to the job market.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some areas of employment require much greater social self-confidence than others do. Generally speaking,  <i class="calibre4"> the greater the amount of</i> <i class="calibre4">technical knowledge that is required for entrance into a career field, the less social</i> <i class="calibre4">self-confidence and interpersonal finesse that field is likely to require. </i> Contrariwise, the smaller the amount of technical training and knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p484"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 5 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">a field requires, the <i class="calibre4"> MORE</i> that field is likely to demand in terms of interpersonal finesse and social self confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there are certain ascetic moralists passing themselves off as "therapists" who argue that the loveshy would benefit enormously from entrance into employment situations that require assertiveness and interpersonal self-confidence for financial survival. My own observations have convinced me that such psychoemotionally harrowing employment situations (e.g., commission sales) cause the loveshy to withdraw even more deeply into their shells. And they cause ever worsening feelings of discouragement, personal worthlessness, and financial failure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During their undergraduate years most loveshy men drift into academic majors that usually come under the headings of <i class="calibre4"> liberal arts,</i> <i class="calibre4">social sciences, </i> and <i class="calibre4"> humanities. </i> These majors include such fields as theatre arts, psychology, sociology, English and American literature, music, philosophy, history, anthropology, education, geography, and political science. Often the loveshy will be attracted to these disciplines because they seem to offer something in terms of self-knowledge.1 Thus, they provide what some in the helping professions call <i class="calibre4"> bibliotherapy</i>—self-insight derived from the reading and studying of books. Some loveshy men become so delighted by their expanding self-awareness that they actually go on to earn masters and doctorate degrees in these disciplines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in so doing, they often render themselves unemployable. This is true because it is <i class="calibre4"> far, far more difficult</i> for a person <i class="calibre4"> with a graduate degree</i> in one of these disciplines to obtain a job in some mainstream area of business, than it is for a person with merely a bachelors degree in one of them to get a job.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intellectual self-enlightenment or "insight" is now recognized by most psychologists as being quite useless from the standpoint of curing loveshyness. Insight is an <i class="calibre4"> intellectual</i> attribute, and as such it does not even begin to deal with a person's fears about experiencing interpersonal anxiety. The loveshy are victims of a kind of <i class="calibre4"> people-phobia. </i> And like any phobia, the <i class="calibre4"> emotional</i> (NOT the intellectual) components of the person must be effectively reached and affected if therapeutic advances are to be made. Given the fact that there appears to be a strong biological-physiological base behind the overstrong anxiety-prone feelings of the loveshy, it seems likely that for any therapy to work it would have to deal with these inborn biologically based components of shyness <i class="calibre4"> as well</i> <i class="calibre4">as</i> those facets of shyness that are rooted in faulty learning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It can be asserted with considerably certainty that loveshy men who major in technical fields and who develop salable, technical skills, adjust to their adult lives a great deal better than do loveshys who major in the liberal arts, social science, education and humanities disciplines.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p485"></a>4 5 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the loveshy college student who feels that he must take some of these <i class="calibre4"> "self-knowledge" </i> courses should either (1) attend college a fifth year so that he can complete his <i class="calibre4"> technical</i> degree and still take the "self-knowledge" courses that he so desperately wishes to take, or (2) complete his <i class="calibre4"> technical</i> degree first and then take the "self-knowledge" courses (while he is working) in the evening division of some nearby college or university.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A socially self-confident person need not be anywhere nearly so careful. Such a person can emerge from his university training with a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"C" </i> average and a degree in English or psychology or geography, etc., and end up making $30,000 or more in his second full year of employment—for example, in some sales capacity. Approximately 85</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of all Americans with annual incomes in excess of $60,000 derive those incomes from commission sales work. And most of these jobs require no specialized or technical training of any sort. Indeed, many of these jobs realistically permit incomes in the $30,000 range within the first year on the job. Second and subsequent years can easily net the conscientious, competitive worker $60,000 or more.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no shortage of sales career opportunities. But these jobs all require individuals who are (1) naturally sociable, (2) relaxed, (3) socially self-confident, (4) high on interpersonal finesse, (5) high on positive mental attitude, and (6) unusually insensitive to interpersonal anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This last point is the most crucial. Successful sales people all have unusually high anxiety thresholds; social kinds of stimuli simply do not unruffle them. In stark contrast, loveshy males suffer from a severe and chronic people-phobia. Temperamentally they are 180 degrees different from what is required for success in a career involving commission sales work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an important reason for my citing commission sales work in this chapter. Most loveshy men without some form of technical training eventually end up working in commission sales for various quite brief periods of time. And inevitably the experiences they encountr during these periods prove quite traumatic and emotionally harrowing for them. It is not simply a matter of extreme polar opposites attracting—</p>
<p class="calibre1">although I think that may have at least something to do with the fact that loveshys without technical skills almost always manage to get roped in on at least one or two selling jobs. There are two key factors which I think are of prime importance: (1) commission sales jobs are plentiful, and sales managers will commonly "try out" two-thirds or more of all people who walk through the door asking for a job. University graduates and others with white-collar backgrounds will almost never be turned away. Thus, in sales work those who are taken on are allowed by the manager to "recruit" and to "screen" themselves. Only about two out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p486"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 5 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">of every 100 eventually "make the grade". The other 98 voluntarily quit after varying lengths of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second (2) key factor is that loveshy men do not possess the charm, polish and finesse necessary for talking themselves into white-collar career positions that do not require a technical degree. There are plenty of such jobs "out there". But such positions ordinarily require the applicant to be "hooked in" to a social network, and to have friends and/or relatives who are willing to speak on his behalf. As the data in this book have made painfully clear, loveshys have few or no friendships, and their kinship networks similarly tend to be very weak, nonexistent, or very unhelpful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, young men are occasionally recruited for good, entry level career opportunities through newspaper job ads. However, in such cases the employment interviewer will almost always opt for the charming, handsome, well-groomed young man who appears naturally friendly, relaxed, sociable and spontaneous. The loveshy young man simply cannot compete—not even if his university grade-point average had been far superior to that of the sociable charmers who are accorded the better opportunities. The net upshot of all of this is that LOVESHY MEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">NEED A SALABLE TECHNICAL SKILL WHICH WILL EFFECTIVELY</p>
<p class="calibre1">PERMIT THEM TO COMPENSATE FOR DEFICITS IN THEIR PERSONALITY AND LOOKS.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">On Selling an Employment Interviewer</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">People who emerge from college with liberal arts degrees have occasionally been known to obtain business-related career opportunities outside the fields of sales and marketing. But this is actually very rare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to obtain such a career opportunity a person would ordinarily have to <i class="calibre4"> sell</i> an employment interviewer on the prudence and desirability of creating a new position just for him—and hiring him for that position <i class="calibre4">without</i> advertising it. Accomplishing something like this typically requires a charming, highly sociable personality with a good sized friendship network. It also requires an above average physical appearance together with an ability to articulate one's ideas vis-a-vis the interviewer in a relaxed yet incisively convincing, winning way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, the person with an academic background in such practical fields as accounting, finance, engineering, etc., virtually never finds himself in the highly uncomfortable position of having to sell an employer on the idea of creating a new position just for him. The employer has placed an ad for someone with a background in engineering, accounting, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> And all the job interviewee needs to do is to convince the interviewer</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p487"></a>4 5 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he would be a more suitable candidate for the job than his com-petitors. If he fails to win the position, little is lost. A trained accountant, engineer, etc., can travel to any metropolitan area of his choosing and find a copious abundance of employment advertisements for applicable positions. A person without technical training cannot do this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, a person without technical training must depend upon the power and charm of his personality to win and to keep employment opportunities. The loveshy tend to lack both the power and the charm factors as well as the physical attractiveness assets that would be instrumental in motivating an employment interviewer to think twice about them. More importantly, the severely loveshy individual is normally so emotionally incapable of even trying to sell an employer that he ends up making no attempts at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the nutshell, this is why severly loveshy, college educated men without technical training almost always end up underemployed. They end up in lower level clerical positions and as cab drivers, door-to-door canvassers, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Such unstable and disappointing employment situations serve to lower the loveshys' self-images to an ever worse degree. Such positions similarly serve to further reduce the loveshys' chances of ever meeting an appropriate woman for dating, courtship, and marriage.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Importance of Being in Demand</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rugged individualists often delight in reminding us of a statement which the playwright George Bernard Shaw once made. In effect, "the people who get on in this world are those who are constantly on the lookout for new opportunities; and when they cannot find them they create their own opportunities." No evidence has ever been presented suggesting that loveshy men are any less intelligent than the rest of us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, many loveshys have no shortage of creative ideas. The problem is that they do not have the nerve to do and say the things which their God-given native intelligence tells them to do and say.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why it is of the utmost importance for loveshy men to take whatever steps may be necessary while they are young to give themselves the virtue of being <i class="calibre4"> in demand</i> from a career standpoint. Inasmuch as their loveshyness obviates their being "in demand" socially and heterosexually, creative, meaningful and enjoyable work represents one area wherein it is within the realm of feasibility for them to find some sense of positive enthusiasm for their lives—and also some semblance of a social life. Involvement in meaningful, well-paid work can do much to bolster a person's overall self-esteem. And it can further serve to increase even a severely loveshy man's romantic chances.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p488"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 5 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of their thin-skinned, low anxiety threshold attributes, it is simply not realistic to expect severely loveshy men to "create their own opportunities" when the going (employment-wise) gets tough. And this is why in counseling severely loveshy men I always make it a point to emphasize as strongly as I can the desirability— <i class="calibre4">indeed the necessity</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their choosing and completing a college major which will place their services <i class="calibre4"> in demand</i> as far as the labor market is concerned. Since loveshys are not emotionally capable of "hustling", they must be prepared to carry what they have to offer (technical knowledge) <i class="calibre4"> in their minds. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And that technical knowledge must be of a sort which society deems to be in demand, and which will continue to be in demand for the fore-seeable future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard, loveshys owe it to themselves to <i class="calibre4"> get the objective</i> <i class="calibre4">facts</i> regarding job trends in the areas of specialized career endeavor that they are considering. University professors are <i class="calibre4"> the last place</i> to go to in order to acquire this information. Professors have a personal vested interest in selling their discipline to naive but reasonably intelligent undergraduates. This is one reason why we have so many highly educated cab drivers and welfare recipients today. Colleges and universities are essentially <i class="calibre4"> sales organizations</i> in the same sense as Bristol Myers, General Mills, General Motors, Colgate-Palmolive, Encyclopaedia Bri-tannica, and Coors Beer, etc., are sales organizations. Moreover, each individual university department represents a separate sales organization with strong vested interests in assuring plenty of students (both graduate and undergraduate) for its teaching staff.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why young people need to obtain their information on career trends from as many <i class="calibre4"> objective</i> sources as possible. City libraries and personnel agencies can provide many helpful hints in this regard. So can frequent surveys of the employment advertisements that appear in the major daily newspaper of the metropolitan area in which one hopes to reside. Except for sales and marketing,  <i class="calibre4"> the greater the number of job ads</i> <i class="calibre4">that appear for a particular occupational or career category, the safer that occupational or career category will prove for the loveshy individual. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Alleged "Frills" in Education</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There has been a great deal of discussion in recent years about the alleged "frills" in education. Many well-meaning conservatives want education to "get back to the basics" of the "three Rs". They angrily clamor against the use of school resources and public funding for such</p>
<p class="calibre1">"frivilous" activities as interpersonal skills training, sex and family life education, parenting education, music, and even recreation.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p489"></a>4 5 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think we might all stand to benefit a great deal by giving careful thought and consideration to some comments recently made by well-known American industrialist and mulit-millionaire M. R. Kopmeyer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Kopmeyer pointed out, all we need to do is have a good look around at the hundreds of educated derelicts and chronically unemployed and underemployed individuals. An assessment of their situation should incisively convince anyone that education of the intellect <i class="calibre4"> by itself is</i> quite insufficient to provide young people with all the ingredients they will require to be successful and happy in today's world. Positive mental attitude, social self-confidence and strong interpersonal finesse rank <i class="calibre4"> at</i> <i class="calibre4">the head of the list of what is actually required. </i> And the sort of education recommended by conservative "back to basics" protagonists does not even begin to speak to these highly crucial human attributes. (Remember the study cited in chapter one: better than 90 percent of all employment terminations in middle-class white-collar employment are caused by <i class="calibre4">interpersonal shortcomings, </i> NOT by unsatisfactory technical competence/</p>
<p class="calibre1">performance.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">A person can possess an outstanding graduate education and a very high grade-point average.  <i class="calibre4"> And he can still fail. </i> On the other hand, in today's society there are thousands of enormously successful individuals who never got beyond high school. Indeed, there are many high school graduates who had been quite bored with school, and who managed to move straight upward to $50,000 and $60,000 per year careers (particularly in sales) without taking any additional formal education above and beyond their high school training.2</p>
<p class="calibre1">Very often that which is touted as "frills" lies at the very core of what is <i class="calibre4"> truly</i> important, whereas that which is deemed to be of central importance is <i class="calibre4"> really</i> of quite secondary importance and can be picked up at any time of life. For example, it is well known that technical, academic, intellectual skills can be effectively learned <i class="calibre4"> at any time in life-Yet</i> is it <i class="calibre4"> also</i> well known that deficits in the self-image, psychoemotional life, mental attitude, social self-confidence, etc., cannot be remedied anywhere nearly as easily after a child has grown beyond the ages of approximately 12 or 13. In short, giving people what they need in terms of social self-confidence, positive mental attitude and psychoemotional health, seems to entail a <i class="calibre4"> time limit</i>—not a rigid time limit, but a time limit nonetheless. In stark contrast, the learning of intellectual skills such as reading, writing and arithmetic, knows <i class="calibre4"> no time limit. </i> Unlike the emotions, the intellect can be educated with equal effectiveness at any point in life. Indeed, for some people (e.g., the hyperactive), education can actually be accomplished far more easily in the late teens and twenties than it can during middle and late childhood. And, of course, some</p>

<p class="calibre1">normally bright individuals ought not attend college until they get to be 25 or more years of age.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Higher Education as a Mode of Compensation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many loveshy men seem to <i class="calibre4"> use</i> higher education as a mode of compensation for deficits in their social self-confidence. Some of these men accept as valid the proposition that they must defer the gratification with which a love mate would supply them, in order to successfully attain some educational goal. And as the years go by such loveshy men become progressively less and less mature by comparison with their age mates in terms of the ability to relax and to enjoy the friendly companionship of fellow human beings. Thus, they become less and less competent at the art of acquiring a wife.</p>
<p class="calibre1">American universities are filled with graduate students who are years ahead of their age-mates in intellectual maturity, but who remain sadly in the kindergarten of awareness as far as social and psychoemotional maturity is concerned. As Spiritualist clergyman Paul Mastorakos recently expressed it, these people possess enormous intellectual knowledge, but they lack the rudiments of plain, ordinary "horse sense".</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 35-year old loveshy man with a Ph.D. in adolescent psychology (of all fields!) recently expressed his feelings this way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"One of the main reasons why I worked so hard on my doctorate for all those years is that I thought I'd finally be able to get an attractive girl to be really impressed with me. But after I finally had the degree in hand I found out that it impressed nobody. In fact, I became more shy than I had ever been. And the very few women I have managed to talk to seemed to react as though the Ph.D. were actually a liability rather than an asset. A lot of women seem to become frightened of me as soon as they find out I've got a Ph.D.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think realization of the fact that education doesn't help is one of the most bitter pills I've ever had to swallow!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">For many highly inhibited young men higher education may actually help to create a <i class="calibre4"> trained incapacity</i> for truly "being oneself", and for being able to (as Spiritualists often say) "let go and let God". Further, higher education is often perceived by severely loveshy men as a means by which status, recognition, and worthwhileness as a human being can be acquired. Indeed, a good half-dozen of the men who were interviewed for this study spoke of how they had fantasized women being impressed with their Ph.D.s and M.A.s. Some of these men had actually fantasized</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p491"></a>4 6 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">women asserting themselves in actually trying to commence a romantic relationship. Thus, a good-sized minority of severely loveshy men had evidently believed that women think so highly of advanced degrees that socially assertive, friendly behavior on the part of the man would no longer be required.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As suggested by the above interview excerpt, once these men had actually obtained their advanced degrees they were bitterly disappointed. Not only were the women they encountered quite unimpressed with the idea of getting to know a man simply because he had achieved an M.A. or a Ph.D., but employers were even more unimpressed. Thus, after spending ten or more years at full-time study in a university, these men were not only incapable of winning the admiration and affection (or even the interest) of a woman, but they were <i class="calibre4"> also</i> (in most cases) unable to obtain respectable full-time employment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, social skills vis-a-vis the opposite sex do not exist in isolation. Such skills <i class="calibre4"> transfer</i> to the world of employment and business.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And they provide an important basis for career success and for lifelong productivity. A history of happy childhood play that in adolescence and young adulthood leads to an easy social effectiveness with women,  <i class="calibre4"> also</i> leads unmistakably to competence and effectiveness in the highly competitive world of contemporary employment in business and industry.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Putting First Things First</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Which is more important—that a 17-year old young man successfully master his high school trigonometry course, or that he develop the ability to comfortably interact on an informal basis with the 15-17 year old women in attendance at his high school? Most American parents, teachers and community leaders would be swift to assert the overriding importance of the former. Popular wisdom is unfortunately sometimes <i class="calibre4">extremely wrong. </i> And following it can sometimes cause a young person to go from bad to worse. Those who proffer such folk advice usually have the young person's best interests genuinely at heart. But the action and advice that they offer quite frequently cause the afflicted young man to become <i class="calibre4"> increasingly incapable</i> of concentrating upon conceptually difficult material.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, not all 17-year olds having difficulty with mathematics are loveshy. But for those who are—i.e., for those who are never or almost never seen interacting with opposite-sexed age mates, it is my suggestion that any permanent improvement in study and concentration habits will have to await improvement in the interpersonal skills/informal heterosexual interaction sector of life. Simply put, help the young man</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p492"></a>Career, Money, Education, and the LoveShy  4 6 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">to surmount the loveshyness barriers <i class="calibre4"> first. </i> And once that is accomplished you will very likely experience the pleasure of witnessing that young man <i class="calibre4"> soar</i> in his academic abilities and accomplishments. You will also have the pleasure of seeing him mature (from a psychoemotional standpoint) almost overnight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness will seldom keep a person of normal intelligence from attending and passing most <i class="calibre4"> liberal arts</i> university/college courses. In contrast, the ability to take and successfully pass the sort of university courses which <i class="calibre4"> pay off</i> in today's highly technical job market normally requires a reasonably serene, trouble-free state of mind. Such a state of mind is an impossibility for someone who has long been constantly deprived of that which he has wanted most strongly, and who can perceive little or no real hope for the future as far as finding the ability to obtain his secret desire (a girlfriend) is concerned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, for young men of high school and college age who are lonely and shy a <i class="calibre4"> priority emphasis</i> needs to be placed by educators upon developing interpersonal skills and social self-confidence—as per the discussions to follow in chapters 22, 23, and 24. Afflicted young men should be encouraged to place academic mastery in temporary abeyance until such time as a normal social life has become feasible for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Moving During the Formative Years</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though it is a minor point, the data I obtained for this book suggest that the loveshys had attended a greater number of schools than the non-shys had. For example, between the ages of 5 and 18, fully 54 percent of the self-confident non-shy men had not moved at all. In contrast, only 38 percent of the younger loveshys and 35 percent of the older loveshys had made no moves between the ages of 5 and 18.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other side of the ledger, 34 percent of the older loveshys and 31 percent of the younger ones had made <i class="calibre4"> three or more moves</i> between the time they were 5, and the time they had reached their 18th birthday.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 12 percent of the non-shy men claimed to have moved three or more times between their 5th and 18th birthdays.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For naturally outgoing children from loving families, geographic moves during childhood and adolescence are not very likely to adversely impact upon psychoemotional or social self-confidence development.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, boys with a strong inhibition gene (the unusually inhibited and introverted) may quite possibly be adversely impacted upon by childhood geographic moves. This is likely to be especially true in cases where quality parenting skills are wanting, and where there is a dearth of warm and meaningful intrafamily communication involving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p493"></a>4 6 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the children. Again, good communication lies at the very heart and soul of love. Genuine compassion requires communication. And in our highly competitive society, boys with the inhibition gene require much more of this from significant ego supports such as parents, than do more biologically advantaged children.</p>
