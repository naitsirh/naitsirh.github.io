<p class="calibre1">THE PROBABILITY THAT SEVERE LOVESHYNESS WILL BECOME</p>
<p class="calibre1">A PERMANENT SCRIPT AND LIFESTYLE FOR THE BOY OR MAN.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the earlier in life that deep-seated romantic infatuations commence, the more important it is to help the loveshy male interact with the object of his infatuation as a real live fellow human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, the more severely and intractably loveshy a person is, the <i class="calibre4">earlier in life</i> he is likely to have begun suffering deep-seated loveshyness rooted romantic infatuations. In essence, it is <i class="calibre4"> even more important</i> to help elementary school aged loveshy children than it is to help teenaged loveshy children. Both need to be helped to meet and to interact with the objects of their affections, and to relate to these opposite sexed individuals as fellow human beings. But the research data collected for this book strongly suggest that the <i class="calibre4"> preadolescent</i> loveshy male is the one who is the prime candidate for a lifetime of chronic loveshyness unless he is helped. He must be stopped from learning the loveshyness script!</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is anything but "too young"! Loveshyness is the worst kind of poison for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would suggest that no child should ever have to suffer loveshyness for more than three consecutive weeks at a time. Indeed,  <i class="calibre4"> three</i> <i class="calibre4">weeks</i> might well be considered a good maximum because to the extent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 7 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">that a boy or young man suffers loveshy preoccupation with the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> girl for more time than that, to that extent he is likely to be headed for a lifetime of trouble and unhappiness. To the extent that highly distracting loveshyness is permitted to fester away in the minds of its victims, to that extent eventual rational self-direction becomes less and less likely.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The American education system needs to teach people how to communicate with each other. People should not be afraid of people!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each child is entitled to have cultivated within him enough self-confidence and pride that the possibility of rejection by a girl does not daunt him from taking constructive action on his own behalf.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Field of Roses Metaphor</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In all of nature the young of virtually no species mature at exactly the same time. Humans are no exception to this. In this regard humans can be compared to a field of roses. Under proper care each rosebud will eventually open up and develop into a beautiful flower. The majority of the rosebuds will commence opening up within a few days of one another. However, some will begin unfolding into beautiful flowers significantly earlier than the rest. And still others will continue on in the rosebud stage long after the rest of the flowers have come into full bloom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Any horticulturist would agree that prodding the slow buds to open before they are ready will result in serious injury and possibly death. In addition, the resultant flowers will prove much less attractive than those which had been permitted to open and blossom at their own pace. And so it is with the early buds. Any effort that might be made to slow them down and prevent them from blossoming before the rest will result in lifelong damage and possibly even in death.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The paradox here is that loveshy men appear to have been <i class="calibre4"> early</i> <i class="calibre4">bloomers, </i> and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> "late" ones as most people are inclined to think. A <i class="calibre4">genuine</i> "late bloomer" is a person who truly does not become romantically interested in the opposite sex until he is perhaps long out of high school and into his sophomore or junior year of college. Many perfectly healthy heterosexual men are "late bloomers" of this sort. Loveshy men, however,  <i class="calibre4"> are not\</i> Loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> early bloomers</i> who are temperamentally inhibited, and whose well-intentioned but misguided "gar-deners" (parents and teachers) tried to force them to stop blooming and to attune themselves to the internal timetables of others instead of to their own internal God-given timetables. Most loveshy men seem to have had parents who either thought loveshyness was "good" or who</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>2 7 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignored it and failed to properly read and interpret the lovelorn behavior of their sons.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">"Oh, Leave Him Alone; He's Still Got Plenty of</b> <b class="calibre3">Time!" </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The early blooming rosebud does <i class="calibre4"> not</i> have "lots of time" anymore than the late blooming one has "lots of time". Left to fester unattended, loveshyness can quickly and easily become a permanent way of life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the angriest and most bitter comments expressed in the hundreds of interviews I conducted for this book pertained to well-meaning but misguided parents and relatives who had reacted to a respondent's lack of female friends with the statement: "Oh, don't worry! Leave him alone!</p>
<p class="calibre1">He's still got plenty of time!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, loveshy males at any age do not want to be "left alone". They do not want their loveshyness problems to go ignored and misinterpreted. They want to get out into the flow of life as nature had intended for them. The following interview quotation poignantly reflects the rage which many loveshy men feel towards their parents'</p>
<p class="calibre1">noncaring attitudes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can remember lots of times my mother would have her friends over and someone would bring up the fact that I hadn't started dating yet. I was always delighted whenever this happened because I thought someone might finally do something for me. But my delight always quickly faded to depression because there was always someone there who would say 'oh, leave him alone; he's still got plenty of time'.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And my stupid parents would go long with that bullshit reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't want to be left alone, and I would always fervently pray that someone would do something for me that would somehow get me introduced to somebody. But that never happened. Today my parents never invite their friends over when I'm around. But for a really long time all I ever heard was this bullshit that I should be left alone because I've got plenty of time!" (39-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">One very important point about time is that it has a way of passing very rapidly. Time must be used. And a key reason why so many of the loveshy men I interviewed were so bitter is that no one had ever cared enough to help them use their time productively. No one had ever helped them use it in a way that might have stood a chance of leading to a satisfactory remedy for their loveshyness problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people operate on the basis of the untenable assumption that no young man wants his parents to arrange any introductions with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 7 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">girls on his behalf. My own work suggests that most loveshy men are quite nervous and tense about anyone arranging introduction for them because of a fear of not knowing what to say or of how to keep an interesting conversation going. And this nervousness is often misconstrued as suggesting an antithetical attitude towards arranged introductions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most young people do <i class="calibre4"> not</i> object to tactfully arranged introductions by caring parents, relatives, teachers and friends. And this is especially true with regard to the loveshy. Such introductions serve to expand a person's field of eligibles. An arranged introduction is <i class="calibre4"> NOT a</i> betrothal!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The young person who is introduced to someone still has plenty of free choice as to whom he will select as dating partners and as an eventual marriage partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Male Lesbian" State of Mind</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I pointed out in chapter five, many of the loveshy men interviewed for this book conveyed the impression of being <i class="calibre4"> male lesbians. A</i> male lesbian is a fully heterosexual man who often wishes that he had been born a female. And yet if he had been born female he would still have felt strongly attracted to women (and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> to men) romantically, esthetically, sexually, and socially. A male lesbian is a person who from his earliest years onward had never felt any attraction towards members of his own sexâ€”not even for purposes of recreational play. He is a person who had always felt rather strange, detached, and disinterested around age-mates of his own gender, and who had always entertained the fantasy that if he could only win acceptance from an all-girl peer group he could feel "at home" there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "male lesbian" state of consciousness <i class="calibre4"> may</i> be related to inborn temperament, and <i class="calibre4"> may</i> at least partly explain why the loveshy men tended to have become very romantically attracted to girls from an early point in life.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Preadolescent Love Experience</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Virtually all of the loveshy men I interviewed had very clear and detailed memories of their preadolescent infatuations. And there had been a very great many of these infatuations. Better than two-thirds of the older loveshys and close to half of the younger ones had experienced one intense infatuation after another throughout all of their elementary school years. In short, from the time they had first become interested</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>2 7 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a particular little girl, there had scarcely ever been a period of greater than a few months in length during which the loveshys had not been deeply in love (unrequited, of course) with some little girl. These intense love fantasies had consumed a very great deal of the loveshys' time and psychoemotional energy. From the time of their kindergarten or first grade year until the time when they reached their early thirties, most of the loveshys had devoted a great deal of their time to daydreaming about some specific female with whom they were too shy to even think about making any real contact. Subsequent to the age of 32</p>
<p class="calibre1">or 33, the amount and frequency of these romantic fantasies tended to drop off a bit. But even the loveshys in their 40s still experienced occasional very strong infatuations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sixteen percent of the older loveshys and 7 percent of the younger ones had experienced their first very strong romantic infatuations as soon as they started school. Being thrown in with a great many other fellow five-year olds, the loveshys immediately found the girls to be far more fascinating than their own gender. Most of the loveshys had viewed members of their own sex as being quite foreign to them. As one loveshy man expressed it, "I viewed boys as members of another species." And since the teachers tended to discourage efforts on the part of the loveshys to group up with the girls, most of the loveshys became social isolates immediately upon the commencement of their educational careersâ€”in kindergarten.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember the kindergarten teacher used to get all upset with me because she wanted me to play with the scooters and cars and a lot of other junk that the boys were playing with. I remember I tried doing those things on several occasions. And the praise and encouragement I got from the teacher made me feel really good because I really liked the teacher. But I just didn't enjoy it. In fact, I found it painfully boring. And all the while I would be looking over at the girls and at the things I really wanted to do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I guess I just decided very early that I would have to sacrifice my need to please the teacher for my need to feel comfortable and please myself and just be myself. And after about November of my kindergarten year I never played on the floor with the boys again. I worked with craft things. And I became really good at making things out of clay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't remember exactly when I first began to take really strong notice of them. But there were these two twin sisters in my kindergarten classâ€”Rita and Ruth. They were fraternal twins. They looked entirely different. And before Thanksgiving I found myself looking all the time over at Ruth who was the really pretty one. By Christ-mastime it got to be really intense. When I went to bed at night I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 7 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">would think so intensely about her before I fell asleep that I would feel really warm and wispy and goosebumpy all over. Parts of my body would go moist, and I would dream that she was sleeping there beside me. You have to understand that I was just five years old at this time. Most of the psychiatrists I've told this to think that I'm putting them on. But I can remember Ruth as clearly as I can remember the things I did at work today. After all these years I've never forgotten her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By March and April of my kindergarten year my mother was finally beginning to suspect that something was amiss. She thought something was wrong with me because I would come home from school and just sit on the cold front stoop which was made of slate. And I would daydream intensely about Ruth. My mother kept insisting that I tell her what was bothering me. But I didn't have the nerve to say anything. Lots of times she chased me from the slate stoop because she thought I might catch a cold. Whenever that happened I just took a long walk and dreamed about Ruth. Sometimes my mother would scream at me when I came back because I had been away too long. But none of that phased me. I just wished that I could spend forever with Ruth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then one day in April of my kindergarten year it all sort of came to a head. My mother was taking me downtown to go shopping. And I was sitting with my mother on the bus. Whenever I went anywhere by bus with my mother she would always give me the window seat and she would sit on the aisle seat. I don't know what the hell happened; but this one time I was sitting in the aisle seat and my mother was sitting in the window seat. All of a sudden Ruth and her sister Rita and their mother got on the bus; and they sat with their backs to the window in that seat that's just at the entrance to the bus across from the driver.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I started to blush, and I smiled uncontrollably. And I just couldn't control myself. I wanted to act like I didn't see them. And I started looking towards my motherâ€”out the window. And she noticed that I was blushing. I mean, tears were coming down my face I was blushing and smiling so intensely! Anyway, my mother insisted that I tell her why I was blushing. And I asked her what she meant. I didn't know what the word blushing meant. Well, it didn't take long for my mother to guess what was happening because I had been okey until those three people, including Ruth, got on the bus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My mother guessed that I liked one of the little girls who got on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And she kept poking me about it. And I kept my mouth clamped shut more tightly than I ever kept my mouth shut in my life. A few stops before we had to get off my mother got up and went over to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>2 7 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruth's mother and started a conversation with her. My mother always had a great deal more nerve than I ever did. I mean she could start conversations with strangers like that. Anyway, she found out from the lady that Rita and Ruth were in my kindergarten class. And when we got off the bus she started teasing me about which one of the two girls I likedâ€”which was ridiculous because Rita wasn't pretty at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, she starts telling me that I shouldn't like either one of them because they were Jewish and we were Catholic. I remember I didn't know what she meant by that. All I know was that when my kindergarten year was over Rita and Ruth moved away. And for a long time I was really depressed because I didn't have the nerve to ask anybody where they moved to." (41-year old loveshy man.) On the other hand, some of the loveshys came closer to developing genuine relationships with girls during their prepubescent years than they ever did at any later time in their lives. The following interview quotation well illustrates (1) how the loveshys had relied upon passive-aggressive techniques from the earliest time in their lives to issue the attention they wanted from a girl who had attracted their fancy, and (2) how insensitive and non-understanding adults had used whatever tactics they could to discourage and break up prepubescent love relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second point is of formidable significance from the standpoint of <i class="calibre4"> prevention</i> because if properly handled these early romantic heterosexual interactions could have been used to keep these boys from developing severe loveshyness in the first place. It is far better for a child to have just one extremely close friend than it is for him to have no friends at all. And it is far better for a child to have one opposite-sexed friend than it is for him to have no friends at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following interview presents a case in which the child had at least transcended the point of pure infatuation. In this case the child had actually interacted vis-a-vis his girl friend. And if this interaction had continued over time there can be no question but that some social self-confidence would have been gained. Even if the relationship had eventually died a <i class="calibre4"> natural</i> death, this social self-confidence would have served this loveshy man well in regard to the practical problem of meeting and initiating meaningful relationships with other females later in life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was only in kindergarten when I first fell in love. There was a girl in my kindergarten class and there was one in my first grade class whom I found myself dreaming about all the time. But throughout all my years of education the love that I remember best of all was the one that I had had when I was in the second grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 7 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess I didn't notice her too much right away. But after a couple of months I began to notice more and more this girl whose name was Phyllis. There were about 30 kids in my second grade class, about half girls and half boys. And whenever anything came up I always wanted to be either in or near the group that contained Phyllis. I started dreaming about her all the time. And nine times out of ten if the teacher called on me and I was off in a world of beautiful daydreams, it was Phyllis that I was dreaming about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, one day when I was fooling around at home I saw my mother looking in some big book she had on the kitchen table. That was when I was introduced to the telephone directory. And I looked up the name 'Springman', which was Phyllis' last name; and I found it there. And it also gave me her address.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I already had a detailed street map of the town where I lived.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know why, but maps always fascinated me a very great deal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when I was only in the second grade I started to build up a tremendous collection of maps. I had them from every state in the union, and I had detailed street maps from all over. Anyway, I saw that Phyllis lived about a mile and a half away. But I had always loved to take long walks anyway. And I had a dog at that time which my parents always wanted me to walk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So almost every day I would walk the mile and a half over to Wood-side Drive. And I would walk up and down it several times with my dog. And each time I would approach that street my fantasy life would become extremely rich. However, if I saw someone stirring in the window or on the front porch of the house where she lived, I would immediately become overcome by extremely strong anxiety feelings. And I would run like hell in the opposites direction for a few minutes. And then I would return. By the way, all this happened in the spring of 1948. In 1956 when MY FAIR LADY opened I immediately thought of Phyllis the first time I heard the song 'On the Street Where You Live'. And even today whenever I hear that song I always think of the street where she used to live where I would walk up and down with my dog Punch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, about this time like when I would be staring at her in class she would begin smiling at me. I would start to blush. And I think the teacher became somewhat disturbed about this. Like the kindergarten and first grade teachers that I had had, this teacher was sort of peturbed about the fact that I never wanted to play with the boys. Anyway, after a few weeks I stopped blushing when our eyes met. I would smile at her and she would smile at me. But we still hadn't arrived at the point where we were actually saying anything to each other. But she knew I liked her. And I was very happy about the fact that she seemed to like the fact that I liked her. In fact, I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>2 7 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't think I've ever been so happy in my lifeâ€”even though I was still too shy to start a conversation with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, one day when I was walking down her street with my wire-haired fox terrier her mom came outside and called me by name. At first I was extremely nervous and started to walk the other way. But she seemed very friendly, and she called me by name. She told me not to be afraid, and that she wanted me to come in and have some cream soda and cookies. Well, I felt extremely shy. But something made me turn around and start walking her way towards the house.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her mom seemed extremely nice, and when I walked in the kitchen Phyllis was there and she smiled and said 'hi'. And I finally became involved in my first real conversation with a girl!</p>
<p class="calibre1">That was in March of my second grade year. And from that point on we became very close friends. Every day as soon as school was over I would walk down to her house, and we would play together until dinner time. And then I would go home. My mother found out about my friendship with Phyllis. And she was glad I finally had somebody to play with even if it was a girl. One day my mother asked me to invite Phyllis home for lunch, and I did. And I remember we had lamb chops. And my mother seemed delighted with her. I was very happy. You have to understand, we didn't always agree about everything. I mean there were things I wanted to do that she didn't want to do. But it didn't matter. For about three months we were inseparable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, wouldn't it be great if even by the time you got to be of college age all you had to do was walk up and down a girl's street a few hundred times with your dog and you'd get invited in by her mother?! That's one reason why I'd like to see arranged marriages become available in the United Statesâ€”at least for shy people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember I became eight years old pretty close to the end of the school year. And my mom threw a birthday party for me. Actually this was quite unusual because she only threw two parties for me while I was growing up: one in the second grade and one in the fifth. This particular party was a really special time for me because it was one of the very few times while I was growing up that I was really happy. My mom invited a lot of kids, some of whom had been teasing me quite a lot about spending all of my time with Phyllis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I didn't care. I was glad to have them at my party. And strangely enough, I felt kind of pleased about things even though they were teasing me. Even though I had just turned only eight, I sort of suspected that some of the kids who were teasing me might have been jealous of me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after that time my school let out for the summer. And my parents forced me to go away to summer camp. I always hated camp,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 7 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">but my dad always insisted that I go because he thought it might make me turn magically into his idea of a real boy. As you can see, that never happened. But what did happen was that when I arrived home at the end of the summer I didn't have the nerve anymore to go visit Phyllis. I had been looking forward to seeing her all summer long. But when I arrived home for some reason I somehow lost my nerve. Nevertheless, one day around Labor Day I did say that I was going to take a walk down there with my dog. And my mother told me she did not want me to go. She told me that she had this outing planned that would involve a lot of boys my age and their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And she insisted that I get ready to go on that. She was still after me to become a real boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess the real clincher, though, was the school. Both Phyllis and I continued attending the same school throughout our third, fourth, fifth and sixth grades. But the school made sure that we were assigned to different teachers for all four years. I mean there were two third grades, two fourth grades, two fifth grades, and two sixth grades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I don't think it could have been pure chance by the wildest stretch of the imagination that we were kept separate for all four of those years. And you know even to this day I still feel very angry about that. Like if we had been together again in the third grade it would have been very easy for me to continue seeing her. Even if we had been separated for the third grade and put back together again in the fourth grade it would have been easy for me to start seeing her again. But the way they worked it, I just lost all the confidence that I had built up the preceding spring. One day when I was in the third grade I heard through the grapevine that both Phyllis and her mother were wondering why I didn't come around anymore. When I heard about that I felt really depressed. But I just didn't know what to do because by that time I had lost my nerve.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I was afraid that if I did try to see her again I wouldn't be able to think of enough things to say to her. And silence has always made me extremely nervous." (43-year old loveshy man.) This case interview poignantly illustrates how parents and other well-meaning adults often do far more harm than good in their dealings with loveshy and pre-love-shy boys. It also illustrates how trying to force a small child into becoming something which he is not can almost always be counted upon to give rise to very disappointing results. If the friendship-love relationship in this case had been encouraged or at least not discouraged, this 43-year old man might well have grown in the ways that nature had intended for him to grow. And today at 43 he would not be a severely loveshy, single, never married virgin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This particular case study was interesting in still another way. As I have stated, virtually all of the loveshy men whom I interviewed could</p>

<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember with great clarity each of the many love infatuations that they had experienced throughout their elementary school years. However, this particular man had saved photographs of his Phyllis kissing him at his eight-year old birthday party. While I was interviewing him he brought out several copies of two different photographs. And he suggested that it might dress up this research report in an appropriately incisive manner if I printed them. They appear on the next page. One shows him being kissed by Phyllis while some of his male peers look on. The second one depicts him standing with Phyllis and her girl friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beautiful, Driving Obsessions</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a long standing tradition in American society to belittle and disparage preadolescent infatuations. The term "puppy love" exemplifies the tendency on the part of many adults to make light of the early</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a><img src="index-312_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations</p>
<p class="calibre1">2 8 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifestation of heterosexual love and romance. Yet all of the research evidence currently available strongly suggests that even very young children <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> the emotions of romantic infatuations every bit as strongly as adults do. To be sure, not all prepubescent children experience these strong love feelings for a person of the opposite sex. But those who fall in love at seven or eight seem to experience the emotions of love every bit as strongly as do those who fall in love at eighteen or at twenty-eight or at thirty-eight.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What the ultimate causes of the preadolescent love phenomenon are is anybody's guess at this juncture in time.1 Some social scientists are beginning to suspect that the need for heterosexual love and romance has a genetic basis, and that it is conceptually distinct and entirely different from the biologically rooted need for sexual expression. Some think that the need for love and romance is more closely related to the need for esthetic satisfaction than it is to the need for sexual pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>2 8 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">(See Vernon Grant's book titled FALLING IN LOVE.) Suffice it to say that the need for romantic love manifests itself in many young children long before there is any capability of <i class="calibre4"> sexual</i> performance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some social scientists have speculated that prepubescent love interest may be a reflection of a dearth of love in the family of orientation vis-a-vis the mother and father. A vulnerability to unrequited romantic infatuations <i class="calibre4"> at any age</i> may quite possibly reflect deficits in family love.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But normal romantic boy-girl interests at the elementary school level do not appear to reflect any shortfall of family love.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, unusually early heterosexual romantic interests do not appear to be very closely related to a dearth of love in the family of orientation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor Broderick's research showed that 57 percent of all children <i class="calibre4">with</i> unusually early heterosexual-romantic interests enjoyed happy, loving relationships with their mothers and fathers. The analogous figure for children who did not manifest such unusually early boy-girl romantic interests was 83 percent. Thus in America there is only a mild association between early romantic interests and poor relationships with mothers and fathers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But this statistical association is obviously far too weak to explain the phenomenon of very early boy-girl romantic attachments because <i class="calibre4"> a</i> <i class="calibre4">majority</i> of the children who did become romantically interested very early in life (57 percent) <i class="calibre4"> also</i> enjoyed happy, healthy relationships with their families. Further, there are several hundred societies in the prein-dustrial world wherein it is most unusual for a child <i class="calibre4"> not</i> to become interested in the opposite sex by the age of six or seven.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I documented in chapter one, people perform better (often <i class="calibre4"> much</i> better) than they ordinarily do when they are involved in a love relationship that is mutual and reciprocal. This is known to be especially true for males of all ages. Only unrequited love, which is the basis of</p>
<p class="calibre1">"infatuation", is taxing on people's time and psychoemotional energies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only unreciprocated love seems to yield destructive, self-defeating results.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And only unrequited love appears to cause the development of intense obsessions that keep a child, teenager or adult from attending to constructive, action-oriented behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy seven year old needs to be dealt with in exactly the same manner as the loveshy seventeen year old and the loveshy twenty-seven year old. All need to be helped to stop excessive daydreaming and to <i class="calibre4"> commence living! </i> All need to be helped to reach out to the member of the opposite sex in whom they are interested. The fact that a majority of a loveshy child's classmates may not as yet have reached the point of having heterosexual romantic interests is actually quite immaterial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People must be helped in their effors to climb each step of life <i class="calibre4"> as they</i> <i class="calibre4">themselves reach each step. </i> Preconceived timetables that everyone is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 8 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">"supposed to fit" need to be discarded; such timetables invariably lead to destructive consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember when I was about nine my dad made me join the Cub Scouts. It wasn't too bad; but I can remember dreaming all the time about girls being there instead of boys. I mean I took part in most of the activities, but I did so without saying much to anybody. Like, the kids used to refer to me as the 'man of few words'. I never really made any friends in the Cub Scouts even though I was with them for three yearsâ€”all the way through the fourth, fifth and sixth grades.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe I can explain a little better what I mean. Like when I was about eleven we went on this overnight hike up around the Delaware Water Gap. And I enjoyed getting out into nature. But I didn't want to talk to anybody. All the guys found me unsociable, and the three fathers who led us on this trip I don't think liked me too much either. Like, I'd be off in a world of deep fantasy as I was walking along. And I just didn't want to be interrupted from what I was daydreaming about because it was always much more beautiful than the stupid, boring things the other 11 and 12-year old boys were talking aboutâ€”and the stupid, ridiculous songs they were singingâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, at that time I was really in love with the 8-year old sister of one of the boys in my Cub Scout den. And I remember as I was walking along I would be dreaming that she was right there with me and that she and I were talking. And there would be other pretty girls in my classes who I would be daydreaming about. I mean, I'd see all of them there with me in my mind's eye. But most of the time I would be daydreaming just about my favorite girlâ€”Jenny.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was my den mate's sister I just told you about. And even though I was just eleven, I can remember getting moist and goosebumpy all over as I dreamed she was there inside my sleeping bag with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, when I was twelve I finally got out of the scouts, even though my parents didn't want me to. I just didn't see any point in staying in because I wasn't getting introduced to any girls. I mean, if my den group had been coeducational, there's no way in the world anyone could have ever gotten me to drop out. I just didn't want to participate in anything anymore where girls weren't present." (22-year old loveshy university student.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nearly all of the loveshys spoke of having resented the American custom of segregating the sexes. Virtually all social organizations for elementary and junior high school aged young people are gender-segregated. And these include the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Boys Club of America, Campfire Girls, Brownies, Girl Scouts, YWCA, YMCA, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a>2 8 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even at the senior high school level virtually all extracurricular activities continue to be gender-segregated.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy men I studied had known what they needed better than any of their parents or teachers. They <i class="calibre4"> knew</i> that they needed a copious abundance of opportunities for relaxed, informal heterosexual interaction. Such opportunities had been denied them by a system that they preceived as being totally unjust and insensitive to their needsâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">and totally uncaring about their strong (albeit secret) desires for the companionship of an opposite sexed friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This represents a key reason why the loveshy tended to withdraw from social activities organized for children and young people. They saw no need for further informal contact with age-mates of their own gender.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the young man quoted at length above,  <i class="calibre4"> what is the point of going on</i> <i class="calibre4">a hike with a bunch of age-mates of your own gender if all you do the entire</i> <i class="calibre4">time is daydream about being with and talking with a GIRL</i>!  <i class="calibre4">? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">All of this flies in the face of a quite stubborn bias which continues to prevail in our society. Many people strongly believe that it is <i class="calibre4"> "natural" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">for boys in the eight-to-thirteen-year age range to want to spent their time exclusively with same-sexed age-mates. It is also widely believed that senior high school boys "naturally" prefer to spend the majority of their free time engaging in "rough and tumble" athletics with age-mates of their own gender. To be sure, most American boys develop these <i class="calibre4">typical</i> preference patternsâ€”most probably because (1) they have been socialized (programmed; hypnotized) to do so, and because (2) these preferences are in consonance with their native temperaments anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  <i class="calibre4"> not all prepubescent boys fit these "typical boyish" preference patterns. </i> AND IT IS ALWAYS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO TRY TO FORCE</p>
<p class="calibre1">SQUARE PEGS INTO ROUND HOLES.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy might well have been "premature" by conventional American standards in their overwhelmingly strong heterosexual companionship interests and fantasies. But in blocking any form of realization of these fantasies many of these seemingly precocious boys may have learned to associate feelings of "naughtiness", anxiety, and "dis-obedience" with the thought of being with a girl. In other words, the feeling that their desires for close, female companionship were somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">"not right" for them at their age, may have transferred to a more general anxiety pertinent to heterosexual interaction that remained with them long after they had arrived at an age when heterosexual interaction <i class="calibre4"> is</i> considered appropriate by society. Simply put, unless a child is involved in a clearly dangerous type of activity, it is always best to both permit and encourage him to grow and develop in his own way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An organization called the "Coed Scouts" could clearly become a godsend for boys with this sort of temperament and seemingly precocious</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 8 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">need for emotionally intimate heterosexual interaction. If such an organization could be made a socially acceptable alternative for children of both sexes who want it, units could be established which cross-cut school districts so that in the unlikely event that not enough boys from one district wish to join, there would always be a sufficient number of pro-love-shy boys from surrounding districts to fill the gap. Coed Scouting groups would provide for such activities as hiking, swimming, arts and crafts, music, visits to museums and live stage shows, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Indeed, the only activities that would be ruled out would be the rough contact sports such as basketball, football, baseball, Softball, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A Preadolescent's Preference for a Sister</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshys' tendencies to have spent countless hours daydreaming and fantasizing about being involved in mutually gratifying interaction with a female companion sometimes extended even to the idea of prompting parents to procreate a baby sister. The following interview quotation is both interesting and poignant:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, as I told you I was an only child. And I can remember when I was about eight I kept prodding my mother to get me a baby sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know; I guess I must have kept pestering her about it for five or six months or more. Anyway, one day my dad told me that she couldn't have anymore children, but that they were thinking about adopting one. My dad wanted another son, and he couldn't understand why I kept asking all the time for a baby sister. I guess he thought that if you're a boy you should want a brother. Well, I knew I definitely didn't want any damned brother. I wanted a baby sister.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, one day my father came home with some papers about an adoption. Up to that point my mother hadn't said anything. But she suddenly became quite upset. And she and my father argued until late into the night about adopting. Anyway, my dad came into my room the next morning and told me that my mother definitely did not want to adopt a child, and that I would be better off anyway because they would have that much more to give to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a long time after that I was really disappointed. But after awhile I began to feel relieved. If my dad had gotten his way and adopted another boy I would have really been in trouble. I don't know what I would have ever done with a brother around! I hate boys!" (35-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a>2 8 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Principle of the Superordinate Goal</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a well established principle in the social sciences which states that whenever the cooperation of two people is enlisted towards the completion of some task that is of equivalent importance to both <i class="calibre4">(and which cannot be successfully completed except through the close cooperative</i> <i class="calibre4">enterprise of the two people), </i> those two people will come to like each other, they will become friends, and their values, attitudes, goals, etc., will tend to become increasingly similar. This is known as the <i class="calibre4"> principle of the</i> <i class="calibre4">superordinate goal. </i> And it would seem to me to be particularly applicable to the problem of dispelling bashfulness and social distance between an elementary school boy and girl who may have a romantic interest in each other. Of course, it would be equally applicable to the problem of helping older loveshys as well. The principle has been found to work quite irrespective of the ages or genders of the people involved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In elementary schools it is usually quite easy for a teacher to engineer social experiences entailing superordinate goals. For example, a teacher can enlist the cooperation of a boy, and the girl in whom he is interested, in the completion of some sort of project for the classroom or for the school. They could be asked to do something that would require them to spend quite a bit of time studying and researching together in a cooperative way. The teacher can make such assignments in a nonchalant way which suggests to the particular boy and girl that there had been no special reason for grouping them together. A teacher can do much to provide the sort of warm mutual introductions that stave off blushing and other manifestations (internal and external) of painful embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Love in the Middle Childhood Years</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though it is somewhat unusual for children to fall in love with opposite sexed age-mates as early as kindergarten or the first grade, by the fourth, fifth and sixth grades such strong romantic attachments are quite commonplace throughout middle-class suburban and small town America. Loveshy boys differ in their romantic attachments from boys of normal psychoemotional adjustment in essentially <i class="calibre4"> seven</i> ways: (1) they become deeply romantically interested in girls at least three or four years earlier, usually by kindergarten, the first or second grades; (2) they rarely transcend the point of unrequited infatuation. Thus, they never actually socialize in any way with the object of their affections.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 8 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) They are usually social isolates, whereas boys of normal psychoemotional health sustain many male friendships. In fact, Broderick found that fourth and fifth grade boys with girl friends had significantly more <i class="calibre4">male</i> friendships than did boys of the same age without any girl friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And (4) the need to daydream about and the yearning to be near the object of their infatuation represents a dominating, driving force in the loveshys' lives; they care about very little else. Male peers, parents, schoolwork, etc., simply do not matter to them. All that matters is the love object.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fifth (5) major point of difference is that loveshy boys both prefer and need a coeducational environment for <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of their activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy boys don't like their own gender much, whereas non-loveshy prepubescent boys enjoy "boyish" all-male activities quite in spite of their romantic interests in girls which, again, are <i class="calibre4"> reciprocated. </i> And (6) the loveshy preadolescent boy tends to be strongly infatuated with just one girl at a time, whereas his more "normal" male peers tend to develop romantic interests in a lot of different girls. Lastly (7) the loveshy occasionally become deeply infatuated with television and movie actresses of their own age or younger, whereas the "normal" boy confines his romantic interests strictly to accessible girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The following interview quotation is illustrative of typical behavior in a fifth grade loveshy boy. Again, it is quite normal for fifth grade boys to develop and maintain strong romantic love interests. However, the loveshy boy daydreams while the adjusted, happy boy interacts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this sense the two different lifetime scripts (loveshy and "normal") begin to manifest themselves at about the fifth grade year. The adult social behavior of a loveshy man is little different from the behavioral style of the loveshy fifth grader.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't really do much after school until I got to be in the fifth grade. Up until that time I just sort of hung around. But that year they cleared a bunch of vacant lots about a half-mile from where I lived. And they created a park where kids could play at all kinds of stuff. I rode my bike there one day and I saw this really pretty girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know her name, but I knew she was one grade behind me in school. All I can tell you is that love just all of a sudden hit me and I was overwhelmed. For the next two years I don't think I ever missed a single day at that park. I would take my bike there every single day after school. Most days she never came. In fact, I guess she only showed up there about once every two weeks or so. But that was enough to force me to go there every single day. I mean, if something held me up from getting to the park it was like I would be just overwhelmed. My spirit would just be jumping out of my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a>2 8 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">insides! Strange and really strong feelings would penetrate throughout my whole body. And I just couldn't stand still. I just had to get there even though I knew she might not show up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually I never talked to her. All I ever did was look her way as long as she was anywhere near me. If she would look in my direction I would just feel overwhelmed as though hot lead had just passed throughout my entire bloodstream. And I would look away from her for a second. And then I would just run two or three laps around the park, or I might get on one of the swings and swing myself real hard. I think the other kids must have thought that I was crazy because sometimes I would just run and run whenever she would look at me. And as I would run or swing myself I would be dreaming about being in bed with her, or at the beach in the sun together, or just sitting quietly watching television together. This was long before I knew anything at all about sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After awhile I guess she must have begun to suspect that I really liked her. But she never tried to start a conversation with me or anything. I never had the nerve to say anything to my mother or father about it. In fact, I never had the nerve to say anything to my folks about any of the girls I ever fell in love with. I just quietly suffered by myself all through my life." (35-year old loveshy man.) Self-Disclosure Inhibitions</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the particularly difficult problems in helping the loveshy prepubescent child is that of getting him to "open up" about his problems, hopes, needs, wants, aspirations and desires. Young children who are shy are almost always afflicted with an inability to self-disclose. And very often they will not disclose what they <i class="calibre4"> really</i> want and need, or what is <i class="calibre4"> really</i> bothering them unless and until they are accorded plenty of warm, nonthreatening encouragement and time. They must be able to trust the person to whom they self-disclose, and they must feel free about contacting the teacher, parent, counselor or therapist, at any time in the future, be it by telephone, letter, or in person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many school districts retain just one or two clinical psychologists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And these very few persons are expected to successfully trouble-shoot all of the emotionally disturbed youngsters who surface throughout a district that services several thousand pupils. Obviously this cannot be accomplished with any degree of effectiveness without the input of a great deal more resources for the hiring and retaining of trained people.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 8 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">A 37-year old loveshy man shared this poignant story with me about how he had been too shy to tell a school psychologist what he <i class="calibre4">really</i> wanted to tell her during his one visit with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember I was in the third grade, and one day I was sent in to see the school psychologist because I was regarded as different than the other kids. They seemed to think that I needed help. Anyway, there were ten different elementary schools in our district, and this psychologist only came by our school about once every two weeks or so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I was given the entire school day with this psychologist. I was only about eight years old at the time, and it was really interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean she gave me all these tests. Most of the tests were spoken, so I didn't have to write anything. And she seemed to be a very nice person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, at one point she asked me to make a list of the three things I most wanted in all the world. I vividly remember this because she also said that I was definitely going to receive my number one wish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was just a little kid, and I didn't know how she could be so goddam certain. But I remember her calmly saying that I'd better choose my number one wish with care because I was going to receive itâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever it was. She said that she had helped all of the kids she had seen get the thing that they had listed as number one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I remember this more vividly than most other things in my childhood because the only thing I could think of was a girl friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew I wanted a girl friend more strongly than anything else in the world. But I just didn't have the nerve to tell her that! There was this girl in the other third grade class. Actually, she had been in my second grade classroom the year before. But now we had different third grade teachers. And what I really wanted was anything that might enable me to spend all my free time with her and make her my best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I remember I was stone silent for what must have been five minutes. It seemed like ages. And she was really confused about it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean I had done a lot of talking up to that point. And I took all her oral intelligence tests without any problems like this developing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She was really confused.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, what finally happened was that I said I'd tell her my second and third wishes first, and that I'd have to come back to wish number one. Well, I covered wishes number two and three rather fast. And then I began stalling again. This time instead of not saying anything I started elaborating on as many details as I could think of about my second and third wish. The funny thing is I couldn't tell you now what my second and third wishes were, even if my life depended</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>2 9 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">on it. All I can remember is that I did a lot of talking about my second and third wish so that I would not have to talk about my first wish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was really nervous and I wanted to bide myself some time. But I really couldn't think very easily because I was talking about something entirely different from what I was trying to think about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, finally I just couldn't think of anything else to say. I couldn't stall her anymore, and I had to get to the first wish. Well, dammit, I just didn't have the nerve to tell her. So I finally told her that I wanted a dog! Actually I did want a dog, but that wasn't what I really and truly wanted more than anything else in the world. I wanted a girl friend. And I remember that for the rest of the school year I went through mental turmoil inside because I didn't have the nerve to tell her what I really wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You know what? Well, I don't think two weeks went by before my father came home one night with a standard poodle puppy! I know neither of my parents had especially wanted a dog. I think this school psychologist must have talked to them. Anyway, this psychologist's prophecy was fulfilled at my expense! I was delighted to have the dog, but I would have exchanged it in an instant for what I <i class="calibre4"> really</i> wanted. I didn't get my <i class="calibre4"> real</i> number one. To this day I keep wondering what would have happened if I had told her what my <i class="calibre4"> real</i> number one desire was!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">To this 37-year old man this incident had long taken on a kind of occult, mystical significance. However, even if the psychologist had been unable to get him the specific girl friend whom he so dearly craved, she should have at least been made aware of what had truly been on his mind. She should have been made aware of what his strongest desire <i class="calibre4">actually</i> was. For without this information there was really no chance of her ever truly helping him in a whole host of other waysâ€”including the ways which had been of pertinence to the reasons for his having been sent by his third grade teacher to see a school psychologist in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In cases similar to this one the child needs to be accorded regular access to a trained psychologist. Moreover, the child needs to be shown various alternative ways for getting his information across, if he is too shy to say it all out loud. In the above instance the child had become able to explain his true feelings and wishes upon actually receiving the dog. In fact, to listen to him today he may have even been ready on the very next day of schoolâ€” <i class="calibre4">if the psychologist had been there</i> the next day ready to listen to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, troubled youngsters need to have regular access to friendly, nonthreatening clinical staff. In addition to this regular access, they also</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 9 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to be supplied with alternative means for relaying important information to therapeutic staff. Again, letter writing is an important alternative means of contact. Another might be in-depth hypnosis. Generally speaking, most children are far more hypnotizable than adults. And this is a fact that should be constructively capitalized upon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not having the nerve to talk about strong heterosexual love needs and desires is a condition that often persists among loveshy males well into adolescence, and sometimes even into adulthood. It is a problem which can and often does prove quite costly to parents who may be operating under the illusion that conventional psychiatric treatment will work to turn a loveshy son into someone who behaves in a "normal"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and socially desirable fashion. The self-disclosure reticence that prevails among the loveshy often wrecks havoc upon parents and relatives <i class="calibre4"> in</i> <i class="calibre4">addition to</i> the victims themselves. The following case interview well illustrates this point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I remember back in 1953 I was a sophomore in high school. And I wasn't doing very well. My parents were always being called in because I wasn't performing up to what was thought to be my intelligence and ability. And I was always acting up. Like, the kids would constantly bully and tease me all the time. And the way I dealt with that was to play the clown. In fact, I think I was even better than Jerry Lewis. Jerry Lewis was my role model at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I was even more 'far out' in real life than he was on stage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, the real reason I wasn't doing well academically was that I just couldn't stop myself from daydreaming all the time about this girl who I was in love with. She didn't even know I existed. But from the moment I got up in the morning until I went to bed at night all I could do was dream about all kinds of beautiful stories involving me and her. I would be in class. But I just couldn't keep my mind on anything the teacher would be saying. And when I tried to read a textbook I would hold the book open and look at it with my physical eyes. But my real eyes were off with my beloved girl whom I desperately wished I could have. Sometimes I would have the book open to the same page for an hour or more. Sometimes I would even get headaches because my physical eyes would get tired looking at the print while I personally was not actually reading the print.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, the principal convinced my father to take me to this psychiatrist. I remember she charged my father $20 per visit. That was a lot of money in those days. And I knew my father wasn't rich.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like, he didn't make all that much money. And I began to feel worse and worse about it because I began to recognize that psychiatry was really bullshit. Like when I first went to see this doctor I thought</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a>2 9 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">she was going to do something to me. But after I completed the initial battery of tests, all there ever was was talk. And during most of the sessions there were these prolonged silences. Sometimes we would just sit there and stare at each other for twenty whole minutes or more before anybody said anything. And it was still $20 a meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The thing that really upset me the most about all of this was that I really wanted to tell her about my daydreams. I mean I really wanted to tell her about how I longed to have a real live girlfriend whom I could love, and how all I ever thought about was this girl. Well, I went to see this woman every week for almost two whole years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in all that time I never really had the nerve to tell her what I was really likeâ€”like what was really going on in my mind all the time. Of course, she would keep telling me that I would talk when I became ready. Well, after two years I still didn't have the nerve.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And when the principal told my father that all of this didn't seem to be doing any good, he finally let me stop seeing this psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, since then I've had fifteen years of psychotherapy with several different psychiatrists who <i class="calibre4"> did</i> know about my need for a girlfriend. So I guess it probably wouldn't have done any good anyway if my first psychiatrist had known about it." (46-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Media Inspired Love Infatuations</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychiatrists have occasionally suggested that it is "safe" for a socially incompetent person to fall in love with a television or movie star because there is virtually no chance of his ever being rejected by her. The probability of a movie star ever entering upon the accessible social networks of a loveshy person is virtually nil. In fact, even a highly self-confident young man might accurately be seen as highly unlikely to ever meet up with a film actress to the point at which he might be able to actually converse with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only a comparatively small minority of the loveshys' major infatuations had involved television or motion picture actresses. Nevertheless, almost all of the loveshy men I studied for this book had experienced at least two romantic infatuations with media starlets before they got to be of college age. In other words, most of the romantic infatuations that the loveshys had suffered had involved accessible women. But a sizable minority of their deepest infatuations had involved media starlets.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the strongest and most intense infatuations mentioned by those interviewed had involved preadolescent girls. For example, one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations 293</p>
<p class="calibre1">man told me that as a 14-year old eighth grader he had fallen in love with Brigette Fossey, the 7-year old starlet of the French movie FORBIDDEN GAMES. In fact, he had been so "turned on" by her and by the content of the movie itself that he sat through it 44 times!</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most interesting comments made by any respondent concerned the family drama I REMEMBER MAMA, which ran on CBS</p>
<p class="calibre1">Television every Friday night from 1949 until 1955.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I guess there was only one television actress that I ever really fell in love with; and that was Robin Morgan. She played Dagmar on a program called I REMEMBER MAMA, which I used to watch all the time when I was a kid. Actually, I never really watched that much television compared to the amount that the other kids seemed to watch. But this was a program that I wouldn't miss for anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I remember it was on at a time which sometimes got me into trouble. Like, I was in junior high school for a lot of the time that it was on the air. And the school periodically threw parties. And the parties were always held on Friday nights. I can remember there were several times when I wanted to attend some social function at my school. But it was held on a Friday night. And I just couldn't go because if I did I would have missed Robin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember some of the teachers used to accuse me of being anti-social. Actually this happened quite a bit because I remember I didn't have the nerve to tell them the real reason why I couldn't come. I remember they'd angrily come up to me and insist that I tell them what was so important that I couldn't come to the party. And I'd say something like 'I don't know'. My parents often got pissed off at me too. But I never had the nerve to tell them anything. They never would have understood.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like if they only had held the parties on Saturday nights or even on Sunday nights I know I would have gone to them. But I know I would have suffered immeasurably if I ever missed one of the I REMEMBER MAMA programs. Like even if they had had video tape machines then as they do today I could have had the program copied while I attended the parties. I even suggested to some of the teachers that if they started the functions at 8:45 instead of at 7:30 I'd be able to come. See, I REMEMBER MAMA was on only from 8 to 8:30; and I could have gone anywhere after that." (44-year old loveshy man.) The foregoing well illustrates another way in which romantic infatuations can have a deleterious impact upon propitious socioemotional growthâ€”particularly when such infatuations concern inaccessible media figures. Of course, during their pre-teen and teenaged years loveshy children manifest many rather grandiose hints that their lives are headed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>2 9 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">for serious trouble. Yet in spite of the middle-class home backgrounds from which they come, their parents somehow ignore the often not-too-subtle clues and messages which are repeatedly displayed. In some cases this may be due to the parents themselves being shy and unsure of themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as is obvious in the above case, the school is seldom of much help either. This particular school was at least sophisticated enough to run social functions for its students. But staff had simply not been available to the boy (now a 44-year old man) that was sensitive enough to pick up on what was <i class="calibre4"> actually</i> going on in his life. Without an awareness of what was happening in his life there was no viable way of (1) helping him towards a viable solution to his loveshyness problems by getting him introduced to some <i class="calibre4"> accessible</i> girls, and (2) of assuring his attendance at the Friday night social functions.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Biochemistry of Falling</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">in Love</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The past few years have yielded a great deal of new knowledge about what lies at the basis of the beautiful and glorious feelings we all feel when we fall in love. Talk show host Phil Donahue nicely summarizes much of this material in his 1985 volume THE HUMAN ANIMAL (see especially chapter six of that work).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The available data indicate that romantic love feelings commence in the region of the lower brain that is known as the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is composed of a dense cluster of nerves which controls hundreds of bodily functions and impacts in a large host of ways the entire nervous system. Whenever a person subjectively perceives another human being as romantically appealing a portion of the hypothalamus transmits a message by way of various chemicals to the pituitary gland.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in turn the pituatary releases a host of its own hormones which rapidly suffuse the entire bloodstream. The sex glands respond to these hormones by rapidly releasing into the bloodstream their own hormones which have the effect,  <i class="calibre4"> even among preadolescent children, </i> of creating a more rapid heartbeat and a feeling of lightness in the head. Simultaneously the nerve pathways in and around the hypothalamus produce chemicals that induceâ€”provided that these chemicals continued to be produced over a long period of timeâ€”what people refer to as "falling in love".</p>
<p class="calibre1">What current research especially needs to focus upon is the question of whether loveshys have a hyperactive hypothalamus that commences to respond and react with "love chemicals" significantly earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a>The Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 9 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">in life for them than for most human beingsâ€”and whether these hypothalamus responses are stronger and more persistant over the first three decades of life for the loveshys than for non-shy people. As I have already documented in chapter two, many components of the lower brain stem are much more hyperactivein introverts than in ambiverts and extyroverts. The neurons of the locus coeruleus and of other parts of the ascending reticular formation of the brain appears to be much more hyperactive among inhibited people than among the uninhibited.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, there is little reason to suspect that the "love nucleus" component of the hypothalammus (itself a part of the lower brain) might not also be hyperactive for highly inhibited, very shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If this is so it would provide a key portion of the explanation as to why so many of the loveshy fall so deeply in love as early in life as age 5â€”much earlier in life than most people experience powerful feelings of romantic love. It would also partially explain why loveshy men tend to fall in love so easily and so often right from the earliest years of elementary school through the years of middle adulthood. Simply put, for severely loveshy men the "love nucleus" portion of the hypothalamus may <i class="calibre4"> "awaken to full operation" </i> seven or eight or nine years prematurely, long before adolescence is arrived at with its normal surge of sex hormones. The prepubescent child who does not have any awareness of sex or of erotic feelings (as these do not usually occur prior to adolescence) interprets the powerful feelings he does feel as being those of overhwelming romantic love.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the first signs of "falling in love" is a giddy high similar to what might be obtained as a result of an amphetamine boost. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">"high" is a sign that the brain has entered a distinct neurochemical state.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This occurs as a result of the hypothalamus releasing a chemical substance (probably phenylethylamine) that is very much like an amphetamine and which, like any "upper", makes the heart beat faster and confers energy. This biochemically-based "high" is experienced by anyone "in love" quite irrespective of their chronological age. The problem for the loveshy <i class="calibre4"> of any age</i> is that they are emotionally incapable of harnessing the energy that is a byproduct of their biochemically-based</p>
<p class="calibre1">"high". In essence, they are incapable of following through, flirting, and winning the attention of the loved person. If they did follow through and were rejected, the biochemical "high" would quickly and fairly easily come to a halt. In not being able to make the approach to the love object the biochemical "high" remains endemic in the loveshy child's brain for an indefinite, usually quite lengthy period of time. And the elementary school boy (or man as the case might be) becomes <i class="calibre4"> "hooked" </i> on his own brain biochemicals. In short, for the loveshy male who cannot approach the girl, love swiftly becomes an overwhelming strong addiction</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>2 9 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is probably every bit as strong and demanding as a drug addict's addiction to amphetamine might be. (The ability to share many experiences with the love object would operate to remove the "rosy colored smokescreen" of infatuation, thus preventing this addiction.) Of course, any "high" has to end. The evidence suggests that males who are able to start conversations with girls in whom they become interested are highly unlikely to experience any painful "crashes". At least their susceptibility to such "crashes" will remain very low until early adulthood. And even then they will be susceptible only if a boy-girl love relationship of many months duration breaks up against their wishes. In contrast, loveshy males are susceptible to such "crashes"</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the age of five simply because their inability to start a conversation with and to get to know their "love-object" causes a long-term preoccupation and fantasy world to develop that can and does often last for many months. As the cases reported in this chapter suggest, all a 5 or 7 or 9 year old boy need do is look at his love-object in a school hallway or on a playground, and his hypothalamus will cause the release of a shot of blood amphetamines that are as potent (and distracting) as a shot out of hell! Despite the tendency of naive parents to use the disparaging expression "puppy love", the biochemical basis of love is really no different for the eight year old than it is for the adult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key consideration for anyone who gets hooked on drugs is that of <i class="calibre4"> withdrawal. </i> Whether a person gets hooked on pills or on natural drugs that the brain produces, the "crash" of withdrawal can be highly distracting and debilitating for a person of any age. But of especial interest here is the finding that people who "crash" after having been deeply in love tend to have an unusually strong craving for chocolate. Very noteworthy is the fact that chocolate is high into phenylethylamineâ€”the very substance that is released by the brain into the bloodstream as a concomitant of falling in love. When the love-feelings cease the body craves chocolate because it has developed a tolerance to the phenylethylamines which it is no longer gettingâ€”because the brain has stopped secreting them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I shall document in chapter fifteen of this book, from early childhood the loveshy men studied for this book had always had a significantly above average craving for chocolate and other sweets; and they tended to consume significantly more of these items than did the non-shy men. This consumption of chocolate and sweets tends to aggravate the loveshys' problems in a whole host of ways as we shall see.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For now, suffice it to say that this craving for sweets may be due in part to constantly being in the throes of hopeless and terminated, unrequited love experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>the Powerful Impact of Preadolescent Infatuations  2 9 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Jack Panksepp, a chemist at Bowling Green State University, has obtained evidence indicating that the brain also produces chemicals called <i class="calibre4"> opioids</i> (which are quite similar to the highly addicting opiates) when a person falls deeply in love.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Chapter Postscript</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of my fondest wishes is to see American parents institutionalize a new tradition which loosens up on children as far as early dating, informal heterosexual interaction, and even sexual expression are concerned. Children <i class="calibre4"> of any age</i> should not be discouraged from having a</p>
<p class="calibre1">"best friend" of the opposite sex. I believe it is always wrong to discourage expressions of love and romanceâ€”feelings which are all too scarce in our world. And to discourage children <i class="calibre4"> of any age</i> from having a close, "best friend" of the opposite sex is tantamount to discouraging <i class="calibre4">monogamy</i> and monogamous proclivities; and this too is not an adaptable or prudently compassionate course of action to take in our high-divorce, rapidly changing world. Males and females do need each other in loyal, monogamous unions; and this is true for people of all agesâ€”not just for married adults.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And despite the often oppressive conservatism in contemporary homophobic America, parental attitudes towards early dating and towards relaxed, spontaneous, unaffected heterosexual interaction, can actually be seen from any logical standpoint as actually promoting homosexual interests and behavior. To be sure, for children and young teenagers in contemporary America, it is actually easier to be a person of homosexual interests (because privacy is much easier to come by) than it is to be a person of heterosexual interestsâ€”although this should not be interpreted as contradicting my earlier research-based assertion that true homosexuality and true heterosexuality are both inborn and that you cannot change a heterosexual child into a homosexual one or vice versa.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(However, experience <i class="calibre4"> may</i> move a bisexual person more in one direction than towards the other.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the most powerful cause of unwanted pregnancy among American teenagers today is failure of many of them to accept their monogamous, loving premarital coitus as morally right for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, conservative parents and religious leaders fan the flames of the unwanted teen pregnancy problem as a result of the norms which they intimidate young people into internalizing. Contraceptive use makes premarital sex deliberate and premeditated, and thus such judicious precautionary measures will usually not be carefully and consistently taken by young people who are not <i class="calibre4"> truly comfortable</i> with their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>298</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">monogamous, loving, contraceptively protected premarital sexual lovemaking. Scores of recent studies strongly support my position in regard to this. The interested reader should consult my upcoming volume titled PREMARITAL BIRTH CONTROL.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Ibid., pp. 294-297. In essence, it would appear that loveshy males are most probably (from very early childhood onward) significantly above average on the brain amphetamines which cause people to fall in love. This surfeit of "love amphetamines" is probably operative for the loveshy from the preschool years onward. In contrast, for most people who are not afflicted with severe shyness these "love amphetamines" probably do not begin to become operative until shortly before the onset of pubescence. Of some significance is the probable fact that there is <i class="calibre4"> no minimum age</i> with respect to when the <i class="calibre4"> love</i> hormones might begin working upon a person's brain. In contrast, there <i class="calibre4"> is</i> a minimum age for the operation of the <i class="calibre4"> sex</i> hormones: they cannot commence influencing a person prior to the onset of pubescence.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>Chapter 12</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Beauty and the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In his book entitled FALLING IN LOVE, Vernon Grant cites evidence that in the first phase of romantic attraction visual and auditory factors (appearance and voice) are vital. He argues that this phase is "of crucial importance", since if it fails, further opportunities for informal interaction which would have revealed other facets of personality, interests, etc.,  <i class="calibre4"> will not be sought. </i> A newly met person of the opposite sex might offer considerable potential as someone who is highly desirable with compatible values. However, in disregarding opportunities for further contact, a potential dating partner would never be able to find this out. Thus it would appear that physically unattractive individuals are at a considerable disadvantage in the dating and marriage marketplaces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chronically loveshy men have an unusually strong penchant for physical beauty. To be sure, virtually everyone loves beauty. However, one of the most significant findings of the study upon which this book is based is that beauty is quite a bit more important to the loveshy than it is to the non-shy. My findings further suggest that the loveshys' very strong need for beauty constitutes one of the several major reasons for their remaining shy and without the regular companionship of a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This attribute of the loveshy is so important and so little recognized that I decided that a separate chapter of this book should be devoted to the subject.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This need for beauty which the loveshy feel is very strong as well as highly generalized. And it extends to such things as dogs, automobiles, music, natural scenery, as well as to women. And it clearly suggests a major reason as to why most loveshy men could never be really well satisfiedâ€”particularly since their own level of physical attractiveness tends to be at least somewhat below average.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the older loveshys was telling me about his very strong love for dogs. He lived in a small apartment with three dogs: a Golden Retriever, a Standard Poodle, and an Afgan Hound. I was mentioning to him about how dog ownership commonly provides many single people with outstanding opportunities for easily meeting and talking with attractive humans of the opposite sex. Yet a memorable feature of my 2 9 9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>300 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">interview with him was how he "absolutely despised" all "ugly" dog breeds such as the toys, and those with turned-in snouts, such as the Boston Terrier, Boxer, Bulldog, etc., those with large heads, such as the Chow Chow, those with asymmetrical appearances such as the Basset Hound and Dachshund, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In short, even amid the world of dogdom, this avid but chronically loveshy dog lover could only bring himself to like or appreciate the <i class="calibre4"> beautiful</i> breeds. To quote him: "It just boggles my mind how anyone could possibly want to own a Bulldog or a Boston Terrier; those things are uglier than puke! I love dogs, but they've got to be beautiful! I'd sooner own a cat than even look at any of those ugly breeds."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately for this chronically loveshy man, it is usually possible for people to <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> their breed of dog, their type of automobile, their brand of music, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> If a person has the appropriate purchasing power, he is free to make any and all of these decisions irrespective of how shy he might be. On the other hand, neither money or education nor anything else of a tangible nature can ever be used to "purchase" the love and companionship of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Need for Beauty</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have indicated, the loveshy men studied for this research very seldom or never dated. They were all far too shy to assert themselves with women, and particularly with women whom they found attractive. However, they desperately wanted to date and to spend all of their time with just one opposite sexed partner whom they could love. Being deprived of the very thing which they had always wanted more strongly than anything else, they tended to fantasize and daydream to a far above average extent. Daydreaming has long been recognized as constituting a vicarious form of wish-fulfillment. And in being unrestricted in terms of what they envision for themselves, frequent daydreamers tend to be quite unrealistic in terms of what they expect pertinent to feminine pulchritude.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each respondent: "Compared to other teenagers at the time you were a teenager, were fantasies and daydreams <i class="calibre4"> more</i> OR <i class="calibre4"> less</i> important to you?" And <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> (nobody) of the non-shys indicated that daydreams and fantasies were <i class="calibre4"> more</i> important, compared to fully 87</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys and 61 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In contrast, 32 percent of the non-shys thought that daydreams and fantasies had been <i class="calibre4"> less important</i> to themselves than to most others of their age. Only 2 percent of the younger loveshys and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy 301</p>
<p class="calibre1">the older loveshys thought that daydreams had been less important to themselves than to most other young people. The remaining respondents checked "daydreams were neither more nor less important to me than to most others of my age and sex."</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fantasies enjoyed by these men typically entailed being warmly loved by very feminine, nurturant, nonassertive but liberal-minded women with long hair, beautiful faces, and very little or no make-up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They tended to fantasize women with a rather delicate, ethereal beauty, and with a gentleness and vulnerability that is not realistically likely to be found in today's world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But curiously, most of the younger loveshy men seemed to maintain a sense of optimism that they could or would somehow one day magically be able to win such a specimen without taking any positive steps on their own initiative. Their fantasies and daydreams revolved almost exclusively around the imagery of already having such a beautiful woman. Virtually none of the shy men ever spent any time visualizing themselves taking positive steps to introduce themselves or to otherwise allow themselves to become acquainted with available and accessible women. Clinical psychologists often recommend that shy people engage in mental rehersals in their mind's eye. The 300 loveshy men studied for this book engaged in a great deal of daydreaming; but almost none of this was directed towards the actual solving of their loveshyness problems vis-a-vis real, live, accessible women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key theme of this chapter is to suggest that "real, live, accessible women" are not beautiful enough to meet the unrealistically stringent demands and needs of the loveshy. Simply put, the loveshy will not fantasize a female face that is not sufficiently beautiful to constitute a <i class="calibre4">wish fulfillment. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As a case in point, I asked each man to respond to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would much rather not date at all than date someone whose face is insufficiently attractive to please my esthetic and romantic sensibilities."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 98 percent of the older loveshy men agreed with this statement compared to only 49 percent of the non-shy men. Among the younger loveshys, 74 percent agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, 49 percent is itself a rather high figure. But as we shall shortly see, the non-shys were themselves well above average in physical attractiveness, whereas the loveshys were at least somewhat below average. People of great physical attractiveness tend to become involved with lovers who possess approximately similar levels of attractiveness, whereas those of lower levels of attractiveness will, everything else being equal, gravitate towards lovers with lover levels of physical attractiveness. The loveshy men realized this natural principle intuitively and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>3 0 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">often intellectually;  <i class="calibre4"> but they could not accept it emotionally. </i> And this may be a key reason behind their loveshyness and their avoidance of women who <i class="calibre4"> might</i> otherwise have been realistically accessible to them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further illustration of this uncompromisingly romantic attitude of the loveshy can be seen in the pattern of response to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would not want to date anyone to whom I could not visualize (fantasize) myself as being married." Fully 64 percent of the older loveshys together with 46 percent of the younger ones <i class="calibre4"> agreed. </i> In contrast, only 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the self-confident non-shy men saw fit to agree. Again, most loveshy men would like to somehow magically bypass what many of them perceive as the cruel indignity of dating, and just somehow wake up one morning married to the esthetically lovely, beautiful girl of their dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An even better example of the dramatically different ways the shy and the non-shy think can be seen in the pattern of results for this question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming that you were able to get along with both <i class="calibre4"> equally well,</i> which of the following two girls would you rather marry?</p>
<p class="calibre1">A. girl whose face is (to you) extremely beautiful, but with whom you have a very mediocre sex life;</p>
<p class="calibre1">B. A girl whose face (as you see it) is on the plain side, but with whom you enjoy a consistently terrific sex life.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Zero percent</i> (nobody) of the self-confident, non-shy men selected the girl with the beautiful face, whereas 49 percent of the younger loveshys together with 73 percent of the older love shy men selected the girl with the beautiful face over the one providing the consistently terrific sex life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, the need for a girl with a beautiful face tends to be far greater among loveshy men than it is among non-shy men. In fact, for most loveshys it is probably accurate to assert that the need for a girl with an esthetically pleasing, beautiful appearance dominates over all other needs. More succinctly, most loveshy men are prone to subor-dinate the desirability and importance of other feminine attributes (including those related to personality) to those which pertain to physical (and especially <i class="calibre4"> facial)</i> beauty. Again, loveshy men seem to need women with long hair, beautiful oval faces, little make-up, and youthful appearances. And indeed, the need for a <i class="calibre4"> young</i> girl poses additional problems for the severely loveshy <i class="calibre4"> older</i> men in their late 30s and 40s.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A good illustration of the sometimes quite uncompromisingly rigid tastes in feminine beauty that are so prevalent among the loveshy can be seen in the following quote from a 23-year old loveshy man:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy 303</p>
<p class="calibre1">"One thing that really pisses me off about some of the women on this campus is when they cut their hair. There are a lot of women around who are really pretty. I can recall a few who I used to even daydream about a lot. And then one day they appear in class with their hair all cut short and they expect all their girlfriends and everyone else to lavish praise on them for their new hair style. I get so mad at these times I could just throw up! I mean somebody ought to tell these women the God's honest truthâ€”that their new hair style makes them look worse than shit! Then maybe they'd grow their hair back and look pretty and romantic the way they should. I think it's really a rotten sin when a formerly pretty girl wrecks her appearance by having her hair cut. I've seen a lot of girls around here go from actually being very attractive to being totally uglyâ€”and all because they had their hair cut. I especially despise the so-called duck tail cut on a girl. Whoever invented such a hair style for a woman ought to be shot! It totally robs a girl of her femininity and it really looks worse than shit as far as I am concerned!"</p>
<p class="calibre1">One 21-year old loveshy man expressed his feelings this way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd love to have a really wonderful sex life with someone. But look at it this way. You can only have sex just so much. I always dreamed of having a girl I could really enjoy looking across the dinner table at. Let's face it: a person spends a much, much larger portion of his life eating than he does having sex or doing just about anything else. I keep thinking how wonderful it would be to be able to have a really pretty face to look at all the time, and to know that she'll always be with you no matter what. I know that if I could get a girl with a really pretty face and long hair to love me, I'd easily remain loyal to her forever."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another extremely shy 45-year old virgin wistfully recounted this story:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It may seem strange for me to say this. But I really wish I could be made not to care about pretty faces and physical attractiveness in women. If somebody could just hypnotize away my need for a girl with a pretty face I would really jump at the chance. I've had several bad memories that still haunt me with guilt. Let me tell you about one thing that happened to me back in November of 1964. I was 26-years old at the time, and I had finally gotten up enough nerve to meet girls through a computer dating firm. They would send me names, addresses and phone numbers. I didn't have enough nerve to use a phone; so I would write to them and arrange meetings that way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, they paired me up with this girl who I think really liked me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I remember she was living alone in New York, and she was from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>304 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kearney, Nebraska. I took her to the show at the Radio City Music Hall, and then we went to a Howard Johnson's restaurant where we had sandwiches and a long conversation. I remember her apartment building was down near Canal Street somewhere, and I remember taking her back there on the subway. She didn't seem to want to leave me, and she asked me at least three or four times when I'd be seeing her again. She asked me to come into her apartment, and that she was going to make hot chocolate. I told her that I'd call her again soon; but I knew I never would because she just didn't have a pretty enough face. Her hair was long enough for me, and she was thin enough. But her face just wasn't pretty enough.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I hadn't begun to think much about that incident until a few years ago. I mean I can count on the fingers of just one hand the number of girls in my whole life who invited me in or said they wanted to see me again. It's not that she was ugly. Actually, she wasn't bad looking. It's just that I've always had this dream that haunts me night and day. I've always dreamed about having a girl with a really beautiful, romantic face. If that girl had only had the right looking face, I'm sure I would be married to her today. I mean the only reason why I could not call her again was that her face just didn't fit the face in my dreams. If she had been exactly the same as she was, but with a really pretty face, I know I would not have been too shy to call her again. I know I could have easily called her an unlimited number of times. It's just that I couldn't see myself marrying someone who did not have a really romantic looking, pretty face."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly the foregoing case is very sad; but it is also very typical of the past experiences of many of the older loveshy men. More succinctly, this quote demonstrates that the very powerful psychoemotional need for a lover with a pretty face constitutes <i class="calibre4"> one of the several major reasons</i> why these men are remaining (against their wishes) "single, never married", and without female companionship well into their late thirties and forties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further point alluded to in the foregoing quotation is that the loveshy tend to feel more comfortable and they tend to converse more fluently when they are in the company of a less-than-beautiful girl than when they are with the type of girl who is so attractive that marriage to her is immediately visualized and envisioned. In essence, the closer a girl comes toward meeting a loveshy man's tastes and predilections in the physical <i class="calibre4"> (especially facial)</i> attractiveness department, the more shy and inhibited he is likely to be in his efforts to converse with her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final example of this highly romantic, beauty-oriented attitude of the loveshy, I asked each man to react to the following: "I would never want to experience premarital sex with anyone to whom I could not envision (fantasize) myself as possibly being married at some future</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy 305</p>
<p class="calibre1">time." I offered <i class="calibre4"> three</i> alternative answers, one of which was "true because I would never want to have premarital sex at all." But this third alternative was very unpopular among all three groups of men. Only 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the older loveshys selected it, along with 11 percent of the younger loveshys, and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the self-confident non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, the loveshy do not appear to be particularly averse to premarital sex or to premarital cohabitation. Thus, with this fact in mind it is illuminating to note <i class="calibre4"> that fully 94 percent</i> of the older loveshys agreed with the statement compared to only 19 percent of the non-shys. The younger loveshys were in-between with 68 percent agreeing. On the other hand,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the older loveshys said "false", whereas 21 percent of the younger loveshys and 81 percent of the non-shys indicated "false".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, non-shy people tend to be emotionally capable of socially interacting with all kinds of women, even up to and including the point of full sexual intimacy. The more severely and chronically loveshy a man is, the more averse he is likely to be to even the mere thought of having sex with someone who does not please his esthetic and romantic sensibilities. Indeed, the most extremely shy men do not even wish to go out on informal dates with women who do not meet their esthetic and romantic expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, these findings do not reflect any moral conservatism among loveshy men as far as the premarital sex issue is concerned. Loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> do want</i> premarital sex, and they fantasize having it a very great deal. But they only want to have it with the esthetically beautiful girl of their dreams. The more non-shy a young man is, the less discriminating he is likely to be in this regard. And this is why very self-confident men are likely to experience premarital sex with a wide variety of different women, including many whom they would never even dream of marrying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, loveshy men tend to be much more demanding and more unrealistic in their requirements pertinent to the physical attractiveness factor than non-shy men. They tend to be uninterested in the idea of even casually dating a girl unless they are able to visualize themselves married to her. And in order for them to visualize a girl as a marriage partner, she must possess the usual "long hair, pretty face, trim figure, etc." syndrome.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the loveshy would rather not date at all than date someone who does not incorporate these characteristics. Most loveshy men would not allow themselves to even dream of having sexual intercourse with anyone who did not possess them. The only physical characteristic upon which the loveshy might be construed as being somewhat <i class="calibre4"> less</i> demanding than the non-shy is that of <i class="calibre4"> breasts. </i> Most of the loveshys in both groups indicated that they were turned off by large breasted women.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>3 0 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">They tended to prefer women with small-to-medium sized breasts, comparatively thin legs, and thighs, and trim figure. This finding did not surprise me inasmuch as psychologists have known since the late 1960s that introverts tend to prefer small-breasted women, whereas extroverts tend to prefer those with large breasts. In fact, there appears to be a rather strong statistical relationship between how extroverted (outgoing) a man is, and how large he wants the breasts of his female partner to be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas extroverts tend to be governed first and foremost by the <i class="calibre4">attractiveness of personality</i> factor, breast size is typically the first specifically physical factor they notice in a woman. In the case of the loveshy the face is invariably the first and foremost physical feature of a woman to receive focused attention. It must be pretty (no make-up), and it must have long (straight or tousled) hair, with no complex or fancy hair styles. When the loveshy do look beyond the face, the second item likely to capture their attention is the legs/thighs (which they like thin), followed by the rear end, which they like small and well-rounded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Very unlike the extroverts, breasts are not noticed by them at all, unless the breasts are viewed as being too large.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, as the man in one of the above interview excerpts pointed out, people spend a great deal more time eating than they do having sex. As most loveshys see it, if a man cannot enjoy being able to gaze romantically across a candle-lit dinner table at a young, beautiful face with long hair, there is really no point at all in getting married or even in bothering to date. This is the quite rigid, uncompromising nutshell essence of the way most severely loveshy men think and feel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, the loveshy (for whatever reasons) expect too much!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, even if they were attractive men themselves, their expectations might still be considered by any reasonable person as being "too much"!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, in most cases the loveshy are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> attractiveâ€”a fact which renders their situation vis-a-vis the opposite sex even more impossible for them. Let us now examine why.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The LoveShys' Own Esthetic Attributes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sad though it may indeed be, most areas of social life proceed on the basis of an equality of exchange. Unless a man has something special to offer such as fame, an unusually high income, artistic talent, outstanding interpersonal skills, sense of humor, etc., he is likely to have to settle for a woman of an attractiveness level similar to his own. Of course, an unattractive man can choose not to marry, and to find satisfactions in other areas of life. He can also endeavor to <i class="calibre4"> compensate</i> for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 0 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">his plain appearance by becoming unusually effective at interpersonal skills, sense of humor, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> As we have seen, loveshy men cannot bring themselves to <i class="calibre4"> "choose" </i> not to marry. And the mere thought or upgrading their social finesse arouses in them far too much painful anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each of the 500 respondents several different questions about their looks. Perhaps the most basic and representative of these simply asked each man to rate his own physical attractiveness along a ten-point scale, with <i class="calibre4"> "0" </i> representing the ugly end and <i class="calibre4"> "10" </i> representing the extremely handsome or beautiful end. The average or mean score for the 200 self-confident non-shy men was 7.36, whereas for the 300 loveshy men (older and younger ones combined) it was 5.17.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was frankly somewhat surprised that the mean score for the non-shy men was as low as 7.36. But, of course, this figure as an average score suggests that most of the non-shy men do not have delusions of grandeur about their purely physical qualities. In essence, the non-shy men had been able to develop healthy self-images and strong interpersonal skills quite in spite of their less than perfect looks. The loveshy had not been able to do this. Indeed, the average to somewhat below average looks of the loveshy merely served to aggravate and to depress even further their low self-confidence relative to the mere thought of asserting themselves in a friendly manner vis-a-vis attractive women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the other questions I asked pertinent to physical attractiveness yielded considerably greater differences between the non-shys and the loveshys. For example, I asked each man: "During your teenaged years how did you tend to rate your overall physical attractiveness?" Fully 65 percent of the older loveshys along with 61 percent of the younger ones rated their teenaged physical attractiveness as having been "below average". In contrast, not one single man among the 200</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-confident non-shys similarly rated his attractiveness as a teenager that poorly. Indeed, 53 percent of the non-shys rated their attractiveness as a teenager as having been "above average". Only 5 percent of the younger loveshys and <i class="calibre4"> zero percent</i> of the older ones rated themselves similary.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inasmuch as attractiveness during the teenaged years may be important for helping young people get off on the right foot in terms of social self-confidence and positive self-esteem, I deemed it important to ask a quite related question in another part of the questionnaire. Occasionally, questions dealing with similar matters yield disparate results.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this certainly did not happen regarding this matter of self-assessed past physical attractiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man to react to the statement: "When I was between the ages of 12 and 16, I think I was a good deal less attractive than most others of my age and sex." For reasons I am not sure of, the wording</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>3 0 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">to this question yielded lower self-evaluations than did the wording to the earlier question. Nevertheless, the self-confident non-shys still rated themselves as having been considerably more attractive than did the two loveshy groups. More specifically, 25 percent of the non-shys agreed that they were indeed less attractive than most other young people at ages 12 through 16; but 68 percent of the younger loveshys and a whopping 74 percent of the older loveshys similarly thought that they had been less attractive than most other young people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, many people improve substantially in physical attractiveness as they mature and grow out of adolescence. But for individuals who start out with already weak egos and very low inborn anxiety thresholds, inferior physical attractiveness levels during the teenage years may leave an indelible mark upon the personality, even when objective physical attractiveness improves substantially as young adulthood is entered. More succinctly, attractiveness level as a teenager may represent one of the key factors which get people used to looking at themselves in a certain way. If a person starts out feeling considerably less attractive than most others, that negative self-feeling may have considerably greater "staying power" than it would have had if it had originated later in life as opposed to during the highly formative years of adolescence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, these points must be taken into serious consideration if we are to deal with loveshyness in a constructive, effective fashion. If (1) a person considers himself to be a good deal less attractive than most others of his age and gender, and if (2) <i class="calibre4"> that same person</i> has a much stronger need for a physically attractive love partner than most others have, then quite clearly that person is asking for (and indeed <i class="calibre4"> requiring)</i> far more of a potential partner than he can give in return.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, less-than-attractive men <i class="calibre4"> can</i> successfully win beautiful women as lifelong lovers; indeed, this happens all the time. But these less-than-attractive men almost invariably have a great deal to offer in terms of warmth, interpersonal skills, charm, and positive self-esteemâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">the very attributes which the loveshy so severely lack. Money, high status career, and education, can also serve as compensators. But as I shall document in a later chapter, career, money,  <i class="calibre4"> and especially an extensive</i> <i class="calibre4">education</i> usually fail quite miserably to attract women. It is only when these attributes <i class="calibre4"> combine</i> with strong social self-confidence, sense of humor, positive self-image, etc., that they can and often do occasionally work to enable a less-than-attractive man to compensate for his less-than-handsome looks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover (and this is the shocker from the standpoint of the loveshy), if a man <i class="calibre4"> lacks</i> a good education, high status career and financial wherewithal!, he may still be able to win the girl of his dreams if he has</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 0 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">the strong social self-confidence, interpersonal finesse, positive self-esteem, and sense of humor. And this is so even for a man whose looks are less than ideal!</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Beauty and the Older LoveShys</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The strong need for a beautiful marriage partner creates a near-impossible situation for the <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshy men. The process of aging does not appear to cause the loveshys to lose much of their strong and uncompromising need for a woman of etherial beauty and youth. Some of the older loveshys justify their need for a youthful woman by what they consider to be their God-given human right to procreate children of their own. However, I suspect that even if children were not an issue these men would still absolutely require youth and beauty in a marriage partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the older loveshys themselves have so little to offer from the standpoint of personality, charm, and handsome looks, the older they become the poorer their chances are likely to be of ever getting what they want. And on a semiconscious level many of them realize this. The following interview segment illustrates the despair which many of the older loveshys don't even allow themselves <i class="calibre4"> to feel</i>â€”a despair from which they try to emotionally disassociate themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When I was in college it was impossible enough for me to attract any women whose looks appealed to me. Nowâ€”Jesus Christ!â€”look at me! I'm worse off now than I had ever dreamed I'd be back then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My hair is rapidly disappearing. I mean I'm balding and I can't do anything about it. The little hair I do have is turning grey. And even though the doctors tell me I'm not overweight, I have this big pot belly. Jesus Christ! What can I do? I'd still do anything to get myself a really beautiful girl. My feelings on that haven't changed one whit over the past 25 years. But I guess I stand about as much chance of marrying a pretty woman as a damned cockroach does! That's why I have all these video tapes here. Seeâ€”I can at least watch these and get some of my needs taken care of. It helps me to forget the way things actually are." (49-year old loveshy man.) A particularly interesting "adaptation" to this state of affairs made by 14 percent of the older loveshys was that of membership in foreign correspondence clubs. One man volunteered that he was carrying on an active correspondence with three different Mexican girls, all 20 to 25</p>
<p class="calibre1">years younger than he. None of these girls could even write in English.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He had to translate each of their letters from Spanish to English. Yet he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>310 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintained a fantasy that the whole endeavor was worthwhile because their photographs appeared satisfactorily "pretty" to him. This man had never actually traveled to Mexico to meet any of the women with whom he was corresponding. Even so, all three of the girls had hinted quite broadly in their letters at their interest in marriage, particularly to an American.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mexico was not the only country to which some of the loveshys were corresponding. Such countries as Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Phil-ippines, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, were also on the list. The fantasy of all of the men engaged in this type of correspondence was that it might somehow be easier to impress an attractive foreign girl who may be strongly desirous of gaining permanent entry into the United States.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the men implied that the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> way they felt they had any chance at all of "getting" a truly attractive woman might be through one of these foreign correspondence clubs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, the way I look at it they've got something I wantâ€”pretty faces (he holds four photographs up to my face). And I've got something they all want. They all want to become American citizens. I mean with American girls I haven't got any chips to bargain withâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially any American girl who is really pretty and young enough.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like I said, I couldn't marry anyone who wasn't pretty and young.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have to be turned on with my eyes of else I couldn't make a move.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know! I've got a fine education. But university degrees are like used toilet paper to American women. You just can't impress an American woman. I wish I could, but I can't. So I'm hoping I can get something going with one of these foreign girls." (48-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">What will ultimately develop as far as these correspondence "romances" are concerned is anybody's guess. Suffice it to say that none of the men carrying on these letter-writing campaigns had ever actually met any of the girls. Despite that fact, several of them were spending a large number of hours every week engaged in this type of correspondence. The process of writing to a stranger is evidently a very time consuming and difficult one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man to react to the statement: "Clothes don't seem to look as well on me as they do on most others of my age and sex."</p>
<p class="calibre1">And 64 percent of the older loveshys along with 53 percent of the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4"> agreed. </i> In contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of the 200 non-shy men saw fit to agree. Indeed,  <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of the non-shys insisted that the statement</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 1 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">was definitely "false" as far as they personally were concerned, whereas just 4 percent of the older loveshys and 7 percent of the younger ones said that it was "false". The remaining men indicated "uncertain".</p>
<p class="calibre1">As part of any viable campaign to prevent or cure loveshyness, clothing needs to be taken into account as an important consideration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The old cliche that "clothes make the man" may represent somewhat of an oversimplification. But those ignoring the inherent wisdom behind this cliche stand to miss out on one of the easiest and least anxiety-provoking steps toward the amelioration of loveshyness. Clothing is something that is within the capacity of virtually all people to control as they wish. This is surely as true for loveshy people as it is for those who are self-confident and socially successsful.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the quite substantial importance of good grooming in our society, I was frequently appalled by the dull, drab colors, old-fashioned styles, and wrinkled garments which many of the loveshy men wore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the non-shy men interviewed for this book both dressed and groomed themselves <i class="calibre4"> very noticeably better</i> than the loveshy men did.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the non-shys tended to smell quite a bit better than many of the loveshys did. (See the chapter on "medical symptoms and the loveshy" for a discussion of the hyperprespiration problem.) To put it succinctly, most loveshy men need a great deal of gentle but authoritative guidance, instruction, and unobtrusive supervision pertinent to the ways of good grooming, clothing purchase, color match-ing, hair styling, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> A person may be somewhat limited in terms of what he can do with the face and body with which he had been born.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there are very few limits on any person in the area of grooming, clothing, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Cloning as a Future Option</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">While it is quite true that loveshy people need to be helped towards the most propitious maximization of what they've got, I think it is <i class="calibre4"> equally</i> <i class="calibre4">true</i> that research needs to be stepped up on ways of assuring maximum physical attractiveness to everyone right at the outset of life. In recent years numerous social scientists have been able to convincingly demonstrate that physical attractiveness <i class="calibre4"> does count</i> in terms of a person's overall life chances. Indeed, it counts <i class="calibre4"> heavily, </i> and it counts almost as much for males as it does for females.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been found, for example, that highly qualified but homely men are less likely to be hired for various business jobs than only moderately well qualified but very handsome men. In a University of Michigan study a large number of men were divided up into three different</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>312 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups based upon adjudged level of handsomeness. There was the most handsome one-third, the middle one-third, and the least attractive one-third. Fake resumes were constructed for the least handsome one-third in order to make them appear to be by far the best qualified job candidates. Resumes for the <i class="calibre4"> most</i> attractive one-third were tailored to make each candidate appear adequately qualified but far from outstanding. In addition, the least attractive one-third of men were given an intensive training seminar in how to groom and to interview successfully for the particular jobs which they were after. The most handsome men were given no such training.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In spite of all of this, almost three-fifths of the men hired were from the most attractive (handsome) one-third. (If pure chance had been operating, only 34 percent of the most handsome one-third would have been hired.) Only 11 percent of the men hired were from the unusually well qualified but <i class="calibre4"> least</i> handsome one-third of men. (Again, if pure chance had been operating, at least 33 or 34 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> least handsome</i> men would have been hired.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, even on the employment scene wherein males are typically evaluating males,  <i class="calibre4"> looks matter. </i> And the higher and more prestigious the position, the more they matter. Every business and industry is concerned with good public relations. And as any American who watches network television news reports knows, handsome faces draw handsome crowds and <i class="calibre4"> win</i> at the ratings game!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the years many fascinating studies on the influence of physical attractiveness have been conducted by elementary educators. For example, teachers tend to evaluate their more attractive pupils more highly than they tend to evaluate the less attractive but equally intelligent ones. Moreover, this positive bias favoring the attractive students has been found to apply just as strongly when women teachers evaluate girl students and when male teachers evaluate boy students, as it does when teacher-pupil evaluations are cross-sexed in nature.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many studies have shown that handsome/pretty faces are customarily seen by people of all ages (and levels of attractiveness) and by people of both genders as being more (1) honest, and (2) intelligent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Honesty and intelligence are highly valued characteristics in our society.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And positive biases regarding these matters can significantly affect life chances. Undoubtedly the "self-fulfilling prophecy" comes into play here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence,  <i class="calibre4"> when we come to define certain things or ideas as real, those things</i> <i class="calibre4">or ideas tend to become real in their consequences. </i> If a moderately intelligent but unusually handsome person is treated as being exceptionally bright, he is likely to very soon become exceptionally brightâ€”because of the way he is treated by everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 1 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Studies of dating and courtship have similarly underscored the supreme advantage of being esthetically attractive/handsome. Young people of both sexes often give lip service to the proposition that <i class="calibre4"> personality</i> is the most important factor determining whether or not they will want to date a person for a second time. However, actions speak louder than words! And several studies involving computer dances on university campuses have documented the fact that for <i class="calibre4"> both women and</i> <i class="calibre4">men, </i> perceived level of physical attractiveness of the date is the <i class="calibre4"> number</i> <i class="calibre4">one</i> determinant as to whether additional dates with the same partner will be sought or desired. If a date is seen as "pretty" or "cute", etc., then even serious shortcomings of personality as well as partner incom-patibility are often overlooked. The physical beauty/handsomeness sets up a kind of "rosy colored smokescreen" so that such deficits are not even noticed or reflected upon. Simply put, an attractive person enjoys positive social stimulus value. And as such he/she is the one who is most likely to be enthusiastically sought out as a dating partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are no easy answers to the physical attractiveness problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems clear that the only way this issue could be fairly resolved would be to work out a way whereby <i class="calibre4"> everyone</i> can be born with the same very high quality level of physical (especially facial) attractiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever I bring this issue up with my students, I invariably receive the rejoinder that each and everyone of us has his or her own tastes in beauty; and that what pleases one person may not please another.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in recent years a great deal of evidence has been marshalled which indicates a remarkable amount of agreement among Americans and western Europeans as to what is beautiful and what is not. In fact, studies have shown that people of all ages and of both genders tend to employ pretty much the same criteria in judging physical and facial beauty. Moreover, people of all ages and of both genders tend to agree almost completely in terms of how they would rank order a large number of photographs in terms of facial beauty/handsomeness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The <i class="calibre4"> cloning of human beings</i> may constitute the only truly fair and ultimate answer to the physical attractiveness problem, and to the unfairness of the fact that we are not all born alike in terms of level of beauty/</p>
<p class="calibre1">handsomeness. One 23-year old loveshy man expressed it this way:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"If the cloning of human beings could be made socially acceptable, every boy no matter how shy he is, could be guaranteed a really beautiful girl with long hair and a pretty face to make love to. Nobody would ever have to be left out because everyone would have the same high quality looks. Each man would also be extremely good-looking, no matter how shy he is. In fact, I don't think that a really shy guy could stay shy for too many yearsâ€”because he'd see that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>3 1 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">he's just as good-looking as the really aggressive guys, and the girls would be coming up to him. I think that fact alone would ultimately give him a real boost in self-confidence. I mean, the girls would be just as likely to approach him as they would an assertive guy. Everyone would be able to have sex with somebody as nice as the girls in their daydreams."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because some readers may be somewhat uncertain as to what <i class="calibre4"> cloning</i> is, I want to define and explain it briefly and succinctly. Simply put, cloning is a procedure that would permit the full and complete dupli-cation of the body of a specific human being. It is a process that would be tantamount to "xeroxing" a particular person's body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, suppose that a couple wanted to have a boy by clonal reproduction. And suppose that they wished for their son to look exactly the same as the father when he grows up. In this case the husband would go to his doctor and have several cells removed from his arm or, perhaps, from the inside of his cheek. These cells would be examined under a microscope, and a particularly healthy-looking one would be picked out. The doctor would then remove the selected cell's nucleus, and then place that nucleus into one of the wife's egg cells. Of course, the nucleus of the wife's egg cell would first have to be removed, after which the nucleus from the husband's cell would be placed in its stead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the physician would implant this doctored cell into the wife's uterus wherein nature would be allowed to take its course. Thus no sexual intercourse would be involved in reproduction by cloning. In cloning, the ovum cell is <i class="calibre4"> "fooled into thinking" </i> that fertilization has taken place. Hence, it proceeds to divide and to subdivide until a totally new human being is formed whose body is a carbon copy in every detail of the person from whom the original nucleus had been taken.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Curiously there is some controversy as to whether or not it is now possible to clone a human being. In 1978, David Rorvik published a book entitled IN HIS IMAGE: THE CLONING OF A MAN, in which an alleged case of human cloning was detailed. Most scientists insist that this was a fictionalized account. However, inasmuch as most Americans oppose the idea of cloning, the case investigated by Rorvik had allegedly been completed in full secrecy. Both the family of the cloned man and the scientists who allegedly accomplished the cloning process wanted their privacy to be fully assured.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each man studied to provide me with his reaction to this statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"When cloning of humans becomes readily available it will be just about the most wonderful scientific advance in all of history because from that point onward no girl would ever have to be born nonbeautiful and no boy would ever have to be born non-handsome or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy</p>
<p class="calibre1">315</p>
<p class="calibre1">without an appropriately assertive temperament; and there would still be hundreds of thousands of bodies to choose from, so people would not all be born alike."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 46 percent of the older loveshys together with 34 percent of the younger loveshys agreed with this statement, compared to <i class="calibre4"> only one</i> <i class="calibre4">percent</i> of the self-confident non-shys. On the other hand, 70 percent of the non-shys indicated <i class="calibre4"> strong</i> disagreement with the statement. Only 32</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the younger loveshys together with 18 percent of the older loveshys similarly indicated <i class="calibre4"> strong</i> disagreement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the objections to cloning centered around either (1) religious values, or (2) fear that cloning would result in the standardization of human beings. However, I sensed a third (3) factor which may be of equal importance. Cloning is not in consonance with the vested interests of already attractive persons. Under conditions of near-universal cloning, an already attractive man would have less basis for experiencing a feeling of superiority and victory for having won the love and affection of a beautiful woman. This is because <i class="calibre4"> all men</i> would be winning equally attractive women. And this would be due to the fact that all women would be of the same very high level of physical attractiveness. And, lest we forget, all men would similarly be of the same very high level of physical attractiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As for the fear that cloning would make everyone look the same, it needs to be stressed that there is a <i class="calibre4"> virtually infinite number of possibilities</i> for high levels of physical beauty or handsomeness. Just as all people now have unique looks (and we can easily tell people apart except for the occasional pair of identical twins), all people can rate a high <i class="calibre4"> "10" </i> on the beauty/handsomeness scale and still have looks which are entirely unique. Again, there is an infinite range of possibilities for beautiful faces. Mother nature could never run out of possibilities in regard to this matter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, during the first two or three centuries after the cloning of humans first becomes available, the range of facial and physical styles would necessarily have to be a good deal less than infinite. But people would still be able to tell each other apart very easily. For example, when a woman wished to have a baby, she and her husband would go to a special storeâ€”something like a wallpaper store. In a wallpaper store customers are shown books loaded with hundreds of wallpaper samples. The young couple desirous of a child would similarly be shown books loaded with tens of thousands of photographs of available bodies. If a couple wished to have a daughter, they would be shown the girl books; if they wished to have a boy, they would be shown the boy books.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>316 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the 100,000 or more photographs for each gender would be cued to a particular laboratory located somewhere in the United States or western Europe. If a couple decided that they wanted to have <i class="calibre4"> Girl</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">#96,125, </i> they would be directed to that particular lab wherein hundreds of cheek cells from that particular very attractive woman are waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the nucleus from one of those cells would be inserted into the wife's denucleated ovum, and she would have a baby daughter who would grow up to look exactly like the body of the woman that they had picked out in the book loaded with photos.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the first century of so of this procedure, the ovum would develop inside the wife's body, and pregnancy would progress just as now. The only difference is that the wife would be rendered pregnant through the cloning process instead of via sexual intercourse. Two or three centuries from now, on the other hand, it will doubtless become feasible for a baby to grow to term in a factory uterusâ€”outside the wife's body. Inasmuch as factory conditions can be standardized, the chances for a perfectly healthy baby would be greater than they ever could be if the baby were to be carried inside the mother as now. Inasmuch as humans will be able to have babies without going through a pregnancy, women will be able to preserve their youthful beauty for significantly longer periods of time. And they will also be able to fully avoid the pain and suffering that has always been integral to the pregnancy and childbirth process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the present time most people seem to have strong objections to research activity that would lead us toward being able to efficiently clone human beings. Of course, people have always tended to fear that which they do not understand. Most people fear that cloning would remove the uniqueness and individuality which today represents each person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if a human being is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> his or her body, if a human being is fundamentally <i class="calibre4"> spirit</i> and <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> body, then cloning would quite clearly <i class="calibre4">not</i> remove the individuality and uniqueness which are so important to each one of us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, suppose that in a given year 200,000 Chevrolets <i class="calibre4"> of</i> <i class="calibre4">the same model</i> were to be produced and sold to the public. Each of the 200,000 owners still considers himself or herself to be a unique person with highly individualistic tastes, talents, predilections, and ways of doing things. And, in fact, each purchaser <i class="calibre4"> is</i> a unique individual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The soul can be seen as being directly analogous to the automobile purchaser, whereas the human body can be seen as analogous to the automobile. The purchaser is free to keep and to drive his or her "vehicle" in any way that he or she chooses. There will always be a uniqueness about that because the purchaser (i.e.,  <i class="calibre4"> "soul")</i> is unique.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 1 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">How much better for all of us life would be if (metaphorically speaking) the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> available vehicles were Rolls Royce vehicles and Mercedes vehicles, and the situation continued to prevail that everyone on the earth plane had to have a vehicle (physical body)! Why would anyone want to be stuck with a Toyota body or a Chevy body when he or she could just as easily own a Rolls Royce body or a Mercedes body?!</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, if the karmic lessons that a soul had yet to learn could <i class="calibre4"> only</i> be learned through ownership of a Toyota body or a Chevy body, then that soul would be "out of luck" as far as incarnating onto this particular earth is concerned. That soul would have to be born on some other less highly evolved "earth" in some other solar system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The analogy isn't perfect because, unlike models of Rolls Royces or Mercedes, there is a virtually infinite number of possibilities for the perfect human body. There is an infinite number of possibilities for beautiful faces and for beautiful bodies, just as there is an infinite number of possibilities for ugly bodies and for bodies with low native intelligence, and shy, inhibited inborn temperaments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reader should think for a few minutes about how much better the quality of life would be for each one of us if <i class="calibre4"> everyone</i> could be born with such attributes as a beautiful face, gorgeous physique or figure, high native intelligence, a pleasantly outgoing but not-too-aggressive (bullying-prone) temperament, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> With such an optimal combination of traits everyone would be at a propitious advantage from the standpoint of developing a healthy self-image, social self-confidence, and enjoying a high level of happiness and productivity throughout life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And most importantly, everyone would be able to date, court, make love with, and marry someone whose appearance thoroughly pleases even the most demanding esthetic tastes and predilections. Everyone's body would be beautiful, and yet everyone's body would appear totally unique. Loveshyness would be a thing of the past, as would such conditions as chronic illness, short longevity, and physical aggressive-ness (bullying). Simply put, I would assert that there is no area of research that is of more enormous importance from the standpoint of promoting and improving man's ultimate chances for supreme health, happiness, productivity and evolution, than research into the cloning of human beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, most of the foregoing is based upon the assumption that the soul (eternal sense of consciousness and of self) enters the body at birth and not at conception. To an increasing extent contemporary scientists are veering towards the viewpoint that conception merely triggers off an electromagnetic energy force field which commences to gradually shape and build a body (shell) which will ultimately be inhabited</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>318 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">by a person if it (the fetal body) is seen through to term. In essence, conception causes the creation of (1) the physical body, and (2) the etheric (electromagnetic force field) body.  <i class="calibre4"> At birth</i> the soul joins with the physical and etheric bodies to create a new person. Again, if the only available bodies are <i class="calibre4"> "10s", </i> then all of the awaiting souls <i class="calibre4"> must</i> choose such high quality bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hypnosis</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inasmuch as unrealistic expectations regarding feminine pulchritude constitute one of the main stumbling blocks impeding the loveshy from getting what they sorely want and need, hypnosis may hold some possibilities as a means toward bringing these unrealistic expectations into line. The major problem inherent in pursuing this tactic is that loveshy men tend to be unusually difficult to hypnotize. The loveshy tend to maintain a very robust, rigid set of defenses. In order for hypnosis to work, the person receiving the treatment must have the emotional capacity to place these defenses in abeyance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most loveshy men would gladly submit to hypnosis, especially if they felt that it would remedy their inhibition problems vis-a-vis women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, from an <i class="calibre4"> intellectual</i> standpoint the loveshy tend to believe in hypnosis; and they tend to be quite enthusiastic about its potentials as a therapeutic modality. However, from an <i class="calibre4"> emotional</i> standpoint they tend to be <i class="calibre4"> non</i>-acceptant of it. Loveshy men tend to have very little control over the emotional side of themselves. Unfortunately a person cannot ordinarily be hypnotized unless and until he is capable of accepting hypnosis on <i class="calibre4"> both</i> the emotional and the intellectual levels. In fact, accepting hypnosis on an emotional level is actually of far greater importance from the standpoint of ultimate success than is the idea of accepting it on a purely intellectual level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of its controversial nature, very few professional therapists have undertaken to learn hypnosis. Hence, there are far fewer people truly competent at administering hypnosis than are actually needed by society. Aggravating the problem is the fact that only about one professional hypnotherapist in twenty is capable of hypnotizing virtually anybody to the point of a deep trance. And a deep trance is what would be required in order for viable and effective help to be delivered to the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A solution might be for such professional groups as the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association to renounce their biases against educating as many new clinicians as possible into effective hypnotherapeutic techniques. If more people in the helping</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 1 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">professions endeavored to learn hypnosis, there would eventually be a higher ratio of available practitioners who could hypnotize truly difficult but intellectually willing subjectsâ€”such as the loveshy. In addition to lowering the loveshys' requirements in terms of feminine beauty, hypnotherapeutic techniques might also help towards enabling the loveshy to calmly handle their anxiety fears. Indeed, hypnosis might even hold some possibilities (for at least <i class="calibre4"> some</i> loveshys) from the standpoint of preventing interpersonal anxiety attacks and "people-phobia" altogether.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Accentuating the Positive</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As getting the loveshy to cut back on their wants may be unrealistically difficult, a more potentially productive course of action might be to teach them ways of upgrading their own attractiveness and desirability vis-a-vis the opposite sex. The loveshy can certainly be taught (1) good grooming and dress habits; (2) exercise and diet; and (3) interpersonal skills together with a positive mental attitude. People who <i class="calibre4"> appear</i> neat, well-dressed, and happy, are invariably perceived by others as being a good deal more attractive, "cute", handsome, etc., than they <i class="calibre4"> actually</i> are. On the other hand, people who usually appear</p>
<p class="calibre1">"down in the dumps", unkempt and dischevaled are likely to be perceived as being <i class="calibre4"> less</i> attractive (handsome) than they <i class="calibre4"> really</i> are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, simply "knowing" these truths could never prove sufficient to upgrade a very low self-image, or to transform a negative mental attitude into a positive one. Because the intellectual part of man is much weaker than the emotional part, any cognitive awareness of truth must be backed up by active participation in appropriate social-emotional support groups. Alcoholics, drug addicts, child abusers, gamblers, overeaters, homosexuals, etc., all have their support groups. Support groups operate in such a way that intellectual insights can be capitalized on by all members. Support groups provide that needed element of warmth, friendship, and caring, that is indispensable to propitious growth and change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshys do not have any support groups. And in this regard I would suggest the development of an organization that might be called <i class="calibre4">Shys Anonymous. </i> Patterned after the Alcoholics Anonymous model, Shys Anonymous would be composed of shy persons of both genders and of all ages. Through a host of organizational activities significant help together with positive motivation would be provided for its membership.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The services of professional counselors could also be retained on occasion for purposes of facilitating group interaction, psychodrama, therapeutic role playing, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a>320 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shys Anonymous would provide important reinforcement for positive behavior and dress patterns. Its membership would display genuine caring and concern for each otherâ€”something which most loveshys never experience throughout their formative years, from either parents or peers. Just as homosexual organizations provide true and meaningful friendships for their members, Shys Anonymous would provide an important source of caring friends to the heterosexual loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The concept of "Shys Anonymous", like that of the "Coed Scouts", is a very important one. And I shall have a good deal more to say about it in the therapy and prevention chapters (Part Three) of this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Summary</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas loveshy men tend to be somewhat less good-looking than most non-shys, they tend to be significantly more demanding than most non-shy men in terms of wanting and needing a very beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whereas most non-shys enjoy meeting and dating women of all types, the loveshy only want to meet and date women to whom they can visualize themselves married. And the crux of the matter is that most loveshys cannot visualize themselves married to anyone who does not have long hair, a pretty face, and a youthful trim figure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a terrible accident were to suddenly blind the loveshy, they might actually stand a substantially improved chance of ultimately getting married. In essence, normal eyesight may actually constitute a liability for many of the loveshys because it obviates their getting close to women who could easily become potential mates. Loveshy men tend to be inordinately governed by the need for esthetic beauty in a mate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, a number of people have told me that my expectations are unrealistic. I used to live in the dorm, and the guys there used to tell me that there were a lot of girls around who would probably go out with me if I only asked them. They used to tell me that the girls I was really interested in were all too far above me, and that I should try to start conversations with girls who were more plain in appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, anyway, I'd be willing to do it if I could visualize myself getting turned on by one of these plainer girls. I've always wanted to get married. But it just isn't worth it if looking at the girl's face and body doesn't make you want to make love to her. With a plain girl it would be just like going through the motions, sort of like a machine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I wouldn't be able to really feel anything at all. And I don't see why the pretty girls should be considered above me. I have a 3.5 average;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>Beauty and the LoveShy  3 2 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">that's better than any of the guys who are dating pretty girls manage to do." (20-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up until now this strong penchant that the loveshy have for physical beauty has been given virtually no research attention. A key purpose of this chapter is to convince the reader that the physical attractiveness needs of the loveshy constitute a very major reason as to why they have remained chronically loveshy and without any major drive towards asserting themselves in a friendly way with women. If the loveshy could be helped to emotionally accept women of a wider range of physical attractiveness characteristics, their problems might stand a good chance of being healed.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>
<a id="p354"></a>Chapter 13</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The major purpose of this chapter is to contrast the sexual lives of the loveshy men with the sexual lives of the self-confident non-shys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Things are seldom what they seem. And I decided that it would be a mistake to assume that loveshy males are completely inactive from a sexual standpoint. To be sure, they <i class="calibre4"> are</i> quite totally inactive from the standpoint of both heterosexual and homosexual lovemaking. As a matter of fact, 62 percent of the younger loveshy men and 36 percent of the older loveshys had never been out on so much as <i class="calibre4"> one single date</i> with a girl in their entire lives. And none of the remaining men (not even the ones with membership in commercial dating services) had ever averaged more than four dates per year.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, all of the loveshys studied for this book were <i class="calibre4"> quite virginal! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And none had ever had any homosexual inclinations or leanings. However, there are sexual outlets other than those which involve <i class="calibre4"> people</i> of <i class="calibre4">either</i> gender.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Masturbation</p>
<p class="calibre1">On a self-administered questionnaire which was privately filled out by each man, I asked: "Generally speaking, about how many times <i class="calibre4"> per</i> <i class="calibre4">week</i> do you ordinarily masturbate these days?" And 85 percent of the older loveshys indicated that they currently average two or more ejaculations per week via masturbation. The average for these 35 to 50-year old virginal men was 4.18 ejaculations per week experienced through the various modes of sexual self-stimulation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In spite of their considerably more youthful age, only 67 percent of the younger (university age) loveshys indicated that they usually averaged two or more ejaculations per week via masturbation. The average for this 19 to 24-year old group was 3.19 ejaculations per week via masturbation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In stark contrast,  <i class="calibre4"> none</i> (zero percent) of the self-confident non-shys averaged two or more ejaculations per week via masturbation. In fact, 323</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>3 2 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">58 percent of the non-shys told me that they <i class="calibre4"> never</i> masturbated at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 3 percent of the younger loveshys and zero percent of the older loveshys similarly indicated that they never masturbate. Parenthetically, the average number of ejaculations averaged per week <i class="calibre4"> via masturbation</i> by the non-shy men studied for this book was only 0.35.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the self-confident non-shys as a group were quite sexually active with women. I therefore asked each of the non-shy men how often <i class="calibre4"> per week</i> he had sexual intercourse. And the average for the 200 non-shy men was 3.5 copulations per week.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now this may seem like a lot; but the really interesting and socially significant comparison among these three groups of men is that which pertains to average <i class="calibre4"> total</i> weekly outlet. In essence, what happens when average number of weekly ejaculations via masturbation is <i class="calibre4"> added</i> to average number of weekly ejaculations via sexual intercourse, for each one of the three samples of men?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the older loveshys come up with a <i class="calibre4"> higher overall average</i> than do the 200 highly self-confident non-shy 19-24-year old men. In particular, the average for the non-shy group was just 3.85 ejaculations weekly, whereas the older loveshy men averaged a whopping 4.18</p>
<p class="calibre1">ejaculations per week! Of course, none of the loveshys' ejaculations involved actually being with anyone on an objective level. But on a purely subjective level all of these loveshy men had been deeply involved in romantic fantasies incorporating being wrapped up in the bodies of highly attractive women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At 3.19 ejaculations per week, the younger loveshys were evidently the least sexually active of the three groups. And yet even this 3.19 figure can be considered somewhat high by comparison with what usually prevails for the typical, sexually active college or university student. For example, college and university men engaged in premarital cohabitation are known to average with their lovers only 2.5 copulations per week. And allowing for additional masturbatory activity, it seems improbable that their total weekly average would be a very great deal higher than the 3.19 (ejaculations per week) figure belonging to the younger loveshy virgins.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LoveShyness and Sexual Desire</b>.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the key point to be recognized here is that loveshy men are very far from being "disinterested in sex" or in any way incapable of having erections. In fact, at least one researcher believes that he has uncovered physiologically-based evidence indicating that loveshy men may have <i class="calibre4"> somewhat stronger sex drives</i> than self-confident non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy 325</p>
<p class="calibre1">That researcher is Hans J. Eysenck of the University of London. And his evidence points to generally stronger and more urgent sexual drives among men whose native temperament places them in the first (melancholic) quadrant of the Eysenck Cross of Inborn Temperament (see <i class="calibre4"> figure</i> <i class="calibre4">one</i> on page 41), than among men whose temperaments are less nervous and less introverted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically, the <i class="calibre4"> high versus low anxiety threshold</i> ("emotionality") dimension has been found by Eysenck to be fairly strongly related to sexual drive, whereas the introversion-extroversion dimension has been found to be generally unrelated to sexual drive. In other words, extroverts and introverts do not differ from one another in terms of strength and urgency of sexual drive. However, people with low anxiety thresholds (high on "emotionality") do tend to have substantially stronger sexual urges than those with high anxiety thresholds (low on</p>
<p class="calibre1">"emotionality").</p>
<p class="calibre1">What this means is that BOTH very shy people <i class="calibre4"> (emotional introverts)</i> AND very aggressive, extroverted, nervous and unstable people tend to have stronger than average sexual urges. The latter group of men can usually be predicted to release these urges in sexual promiscuity and in very frequent sexual activity with their wives and lovers. Very loveshy men, on the other hand, can be expected to display their strong sexual urges in an unusually high rate and frequency of solitary masturbatory activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is exactly what I found to be the case for most of the loveshy men interviewed for this book. As a group the loveshys tended to average a greater number of orgasms per week than the highly self-confident non-shy men, including even those who were premaritally cohabitating with a lover. The loveshys manifested their highly charged sexual drives in frequent masturbation, whereas the non-shys manifested their more normal or "moderate" sexual drives via regular sexual intercourse at the rate of about 3.5 copulations per week. (Again, the older loveshys averaged 4.18 orgasms per week,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> through solitary masturbation.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem for the loveshys is that frequent masturbation does not provide for a very satisfying sexual or emotional life. Of course, it is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> the masturbation itself which causes the unhappiness and emotional turmoil. The problem emerges from the fact that men who masturbate a very great deal usually do so because their fears and anxieties prevent them from making contacts with women and from cultivating emotionally meaningful relationships with them. None of the loveshys seemed to feel any guilt about their masturbatory activities. And none seemed to be influenced by any of the ancient myths surrounding masturbation. But all felt severely frustrated by the fact that they were not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>326 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">living up to their true and loving potential. In essence, being without a woman made them all unhappy and dissatisfied.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, masturbation among university aged young people has been found by a number of psychologists to relate to emotional adjustment and mental health very differently for females than for males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, young men who masturbate three or more times per week tend to be unhappy, nonsociable, shy, and rather poorly adjusted. Among college age females, on the other hand, such behavior has been found to reflect very fine mental health, non-shyness, assertiveness, high levels of sociability, social spontaneity, self-confidence, happiness, and andro-geny of attitudes and values.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Felt Deprivation Creates Preoccupation</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">When a person is deprived over a very long period of time of something which he dearly wants, that person is highly likely to become preoccupied and even obsessed with the thing of which he has been deprived. This is a long-standing tenet of the science of psychology.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I believe that it may explain, at least in part, the unusually high frequency of masturbation among the loveshys. Loveshy men tend to be extremely interested in sex. They have books on the subject and copies of PLAYBOY and PENTHOUSE magazines strewn all over their apartments. And many of them have color photographs of attractive women (both nude and clothed) hanging all over their walls. In spite of their high rate of premarital sexual intercourse, I did not observe anywhere nearly as much of this sort of thing in the living quarters of the non-shy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, sexual preoccupation can be seen as being reflected in frequency of masturbatory activity. And it is certainly very often reflected in the frequent need to read about sex or to gaze upon the pictures of attractive women. In contrast, those whose sexual appetites are fairly well satisfied tend to have little need to read about the subject or to admire the photographs of inaccessible women.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Degree of Satisfaction with Sex Life</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked each of the 500 respondents to rank the overall extent of his satisfaction with sexual life on a scale ranging from "0" to "10". I indicated that a ranking of "10" would represent a very high level of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy  3 2 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfaction with one's sexual life, whereas a ranking of "0" would represent extreme dissatisfaction. The <i class="calibre4"> average</i> ranking for the 100 older loveshy men was only 0.85; and for the 200 younger loveshys it was a mere 1.57. In stark contrast, the average for the 200 self-confident non-shy men was 8.61. Hence, in spite of the loveshys' very high rate of mas-tubatory orgasms, their general level of satisfaction with their sex lives was vastly lower than that of the non-shy men. Again, the older loveshys were averaging more orgasms per week than the non-shys. Evidently the very fact of frequent involvement in lovemaking <i class="calibre4"> with a woman</i> tends to be far more closely related to sexual satisfaction than the number of orgasms or ejaculations experienced on a per week basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a related question I asked each man to rank how satisfied he felt with his sex life along the following seven-point scale: 1. makes me very happy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. makes me moderately happy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. makes me slightly happy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. neutral;</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. makes me slightly unhappy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. makes me moderately unhappy;</p>
<p class="calibre1">7. makes me very unhappy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here again, the differences between the loveshy men and the non-shy men were quite substantial. The average ranking for the self-confident non-shys was 1.36. In stark contrast, the average ranking for the older loveshy men was 6.71; and for the younger loveshy men it was 6.07.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked each man to rank himself on the <i class="calibre4"> same seven-point continuum</i> with regard to his feelings of satisfaction pertinent to "being in love and being loved". Not surprisingly the differences between the loveshys and the non-shys remained just as great as they had been in regard to the "sex life" issue. More specifically, the non-shy men averaged 1.71 on "being in love and being loved", whereas the younger and older loveshy men averaged rankings of 6.29 and 6.97, respectively.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Sexual Values and Attitudes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have indicated, all of the loveshy men studied for this book were virgins. All were quite totally lacking in experience from the standpoint of any and all forms of sexual expression other than masturbation and related sexual self-stimulation activities. Yet strangely enough the <i class="calibre4">attitudes</i> and <i class="calibre4"> values</i> of the loveshy men pertinent to sexual matters were surprisingly normal and "modern". In fact, they were quite typical of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>328 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">those held by unmarried American males generally. Further, the loveshys' sexual attitudes and values might even be regarded by some readers as being demonstrably on the "liberal" side. And this represents further testimony for the fact that <i class="calibre4"> behavior does not always reflect attitudes</i>â€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially as far as loveshy males are concerned. Let's look at a few examples of this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked all respondents to react to the following statement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Monogamous, loving, contraceptively protected premarital sexual intercourse should be considered fully socially acceptable for all people 18 years of age and older."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 86 percent of the non-shy men together with 91 percent of the older loveshys agreed with this statement. The younger loveshy men were the most conservative of the three groups with only 79 percent agreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, only 6 percent of the older loveshys and 11 percent of the younger ones would <i class="calibre4"> never</i> personally want to have premarital sex under any circumstances. The analogous percent for the non-shy men was <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> (nobody). Yet in spite of this seeming liberality and sexual tolerance, <i class="calibre4">zero percent</i> of the 300 loveshy (older and younger) men approved of casual or promiscuous premarital sexual activity. Thus none of the loveshys looked at all favorably upon "one night stands", sex with call girls, pick-ups, prostitutes, or sex with someone after less than two months'</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintance and steady friendship. In contrast, 73 percent of the self-confident non-shys could accept some casual or "promiscuous" premarital sexâ€”especially that which might involve pick-ups, "one night stands", and sex with a dating partner after having known her for less than two months.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Questions pertinent to premarital cohabitation tended to meet with a positive response by all three groups of men. Approximately 85 percent of all three samples approved the idea of monogamous premarital cohabitation as an integral part of courtship; and most of these men would eventually like to engage in it themselves. In fact, 38 percent of the non-shy men <i class="calibre4"> were</i> premaritally cohabiting at the time they were interviewed for this book; and 53 percent of the non-shys had already premaritally cohabited with a girl at some point in their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the attitudes of the loveshy men towards premarital cohabitation were substantially more romantic than those of the non-shy men. Most of the non-shys indicated that they would be enthusiastic about cohabiting with <i class="calibre4"> any</i> willing girl. On the other hand, the loveshy men of both groups would only wish to premaritally cohabit with someone with whom they were already deeply in love and who was sufficiently</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy  3 2 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">physically attractive (e.g., "long hair and pretty face") to turn them on visually.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In another interesting attitude item I asked each respondent to react to this statement: "A teenager should normally be free to entertain his best friend of the opposite sex in his bedroom at home without parental supervision." Fully 71 percent of the non-shy men together with 84 percent of the older loveshys agreed with this statement. The extent of agreement among the younger loveshy men was 69 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, this controversial statement gave rise to almost no differences among the three groups of men who were studied for this book:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Teenagers should have a thorough knowledge of contraception and should be free to freely and guiltlessly obtain it through medical sources without parental knowledge if and when they decide to engage in premarital sexual intercourse."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 6 percent of both the non-shys and the younger loveshys <i class="calibre4"> disagreed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Disagreement among the older loveshy men was limited to only 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Moral Liberality versus Conservatism</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In an effort to assess the extent to which the respondents were</p>
<p class="calibre1">"absolutists" or "relativists" as far as their views of "morality" were concerned, I decided to gauge each man's opinions regarding this "relativistic" definition of morality: "Any behavior is moral and non-sinful except that which impinges upon the happiness and well-being of our fellow human beings." The <i class="calibre4"> older</i> loveshy men were the most accepting of this position with <i class="calibre4"> 77</i> percent of them endorsing it. The self-confident non-shy men were second in line with 69 percent endorsing it. The younger loveshys were the most conservative group: just 63 percent indicated agreement with the statement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another statement of considerable interest to which each man reacted was the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Some have spoken of our changing views regarding sexual behavior as being indicative of <i class="calibre4"> moral deterioration, </i> while others have spoken of this as being indicative of <i class="calibre4"> moral change. </i> Still others have referred to it as <i class="calibre4"> moral evolution. </i> Please check the position which most closely approximates your own point of view:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>330 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moral deterioration;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moral change;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moral evolution."</p>
<p class="calibre1">On this statement the <i class="calibre4"> younger</i> loveshys fell somewhat "out of line": 28 percent of them checked "moral deterioration", compared to only 6</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shys and 10 percent of the older loveshys. For the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"moral change" option there was virtually no difference among the three groups: it was checked by 36 percent of the younger loveshys, by 37</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of the non-shys, and by 38 percent of the older loveshys. "Moral evolution", on the other hand, was checked by 57 percent of the non-shys, by 52 percent of the older loveshys, and by 36 percent of the younger loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I also asked for reactions to this political statement: "Some bathing suit optional beaches should be made available for people who enjoy being nude outdoors." Again, the similarities among these three groups of "single, never married" men turned out to be far more striking than the differences: 87 percent of the non-shys together with 89 percent of the older loveshys indicated <i class="calibre4"> agreement. </i> Agreement was similarly indicated by 85 percent of the younger loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, if any of the foregoing statements were to be read to a group of middle-class parents residing in the suburbs, the level of expressed liberality ("permissiveness") would doubtless be substantially lower than that which obtained for these three groups of "single, never married" men. However, this book is geared towards the goal of understanding the problems of severely loveshy single men. And this can only be accomplished by comparing such chronic loveshy singles with singles who are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> loveshy. Obviously, there would be nothing to be gained by comparing them with middle-class parents who reside in the suburbs!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, a key conclusion to be drawn from these data is that there are very few <i class="calibre4"> if any</i> significant differences between non-shy single men and loveshy single men as far as attitudes toward human sexuality are concerned. Simply put, conservative or prudish sexual attitudes/values appear to have no bearing at all on why or how the loveshy got to be the way they are. Severe loveshyness cannot be explained by sexual values.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, one of my colleagues recently suggested that the loveshys might have been better off if social forces had led them to embrace conservative sexual values. Loveshy men don't get any coital sex anyway. And if they were conservative they could join up with a conservative religious group which might help them meet a girl. As of the late 1970s and early 1980s, fundamentalistic religious groups were doing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy 331</p>
<p class="calibre1">much better than the more moderate to liberal "mainstream" churches in attracting and holding young people, and particularly attractive young women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, loveshy men tend to be quite disinclined towards joining anything! They are particularly disinclined towards the idea of joining (or even remaining near, for more than a few minutes) any group with any semblance of zealous militancy, or any group that endeavors to standardize personalities, appearances, and value systems through moralistic and/or militaristic intimidation. Loveshy people tend to associate any kind of zealousness and/or militancy with <i class="calibre4"> bullying. </i> And the loveshy sustain a deep loathing for any and all kinds of bullies, including those who might be operating in the service of what fundamentalists might construe to be Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, it appears that most loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> might</i> be amenableâ€”if they were both literally and figuratively <i class="calibre4"> taken by the hand</i>â€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">to joining moderate to liberal "mainstream" churches such as Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Congregational, Disciples of Christ, Reformed Judaism, Christian Science, Spiritualism, Religious Mind Science, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a complex and important issue which I shall deal with more fully in a later chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Unusual Sexual Directionality</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In a study of this nature I realized that it would not be possible to obtain absolutely certain, completely valid data on the most intimate aspects of the men's sexual lives. Throughout the many months of data collecting which this book required, I was constantly gratified by the extent of willing and often gracious cooperation that I received. And I did not want to press my luck too far with this group of highly sensitive, loveshy men. I knew that this was to be a study of loveshyness, not of sexuality. And I did not want to risk the sort of problems that might have surfaced had I asked many in-depth questions pertinent to sexual history. My only major concern was to make certain that each man studied was heterosexually oriented as opposed to homosexually oriented, and that each of the loveshys was a virgin. And I am quite satisfied that I succeeded well in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it is known that prolonged deprivation of female companionship often gives rise to unusual erotic penchants, even among heterosexually oriented men. Among the 300 loveshys interviewed for this book only three <i class="calibre4"> openly and conspicuously</i> revealed any unusual fetishes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the other loveshys may similarly have had unusual fetishes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>3 3 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">without wanting to discuss or reveal what they were. Each of the men choosing to discuss unusual erotic penchants belonged to the ranks of the older loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, a 36-year old loveshy man became amazingly open with me about the fact that he often took his golden retriever to bed with him. When I first began my interview with this man he was quite reticent and somewhat tentative in many of his answers. But as the interview wore on he began to open up in a way that suggested the possibility that years might have passed since anyone had ever shown any personal interest in his life or in his interests and opinions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reader should understand that this man <i class="calibre4"> did not prefer</i> his golden retriever to his fantasy of ultimately having a beautiful human girl friend with whom to go to bed. In fact, he insisted that holding his golden retriever in all sorts of intimate sexual embraces made it easier for him to fantasize being with a girl. On one level his behavior had an almost comical touch to it. He called his dog by the name of "Sextimus", and related to it while I was there as though it were a human being. He fed the dog expensive cuts of meat and other human foods. And when he took his "Sextimus" to bed he had a regular ritual in which he would systematically wash its snoot and paws so that it would be "in sanitary shape" for "making love".</p>
<p class="calibre1">During much of the time this interview was being conducted this man and his retriever were lounging upon a large, king-sized bed. He was only partially clad, and at several points he unhesitatingly kissed his "darling little Sextimus" right on the mouth! The more excited his thought processes became in response to various interview questions, the more ostentatiously tactile he became with his dog. It was as though the dog had become a combination emotional support and security blan-ket to him, and he just couldn't let go of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The second man was a 38-year old commercial artist who kept a large and beautiful collection of expensive barbie dolls on conspicuous display throughout his apartment. In addition, he had a large collection of doll clothing that most surely would have been the envy of any prepubescent little girl.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whenever I feel really lonely I get one of my prettiest dolls and I take her to bed with me. Like sometimes I'll take off all of my clothes and I'll have three or even four dolls there with me, and before I know it my tuutuu (sic) will get really hard. I especially like the silky little dresses that some of my dolls wear. They feel so sexy to the touch. I only wish (he starts blushing) that one of my dollies could just magically turn into a real live girl!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy  3 3 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">This man may have occasionally gone beyond the using of barbie dolls as catalysts for masturbation. His bedroom contained two human-sized female mannequins, both of which were fully clad in brightly colored dresses. At one point he intimated that he had paid in excess of one thousand dollars for one of these two oversized dolls. Both of them were obviously among his most cherished possessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The third man did not reveal his unusual erotic penchants during the course of the interview. Three weeks after being interviewed for this research this 39-year old man mailed to me (the researcher) a lengthy letter in which he described his strong coprophiliac interests. Too shy to discuss the matter face-to-face with anyone, he nonetheless indicated that he was strongly desirous of someone from the scientific community learning about his case.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically, from the time this man had been a child he had always had a strong sexual fascination with his bowel movements, especially when they "come out real long and soft". And on those occasions when he had a bowel movement of the "right" feeling and textureâ€”an event which he claimed happened only about once every couple of monthsâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he would become "uncontrollably aroused" from a sexual standpoint.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Using vegetable oil "to enhance the effect", he would roll the bowel movement around in his hands, sometimes for several hours; and he would enjoy several ejaculations while in the process of doing this. He would save his "nicer poopoos" in plastic bags, sometimes for several days. And at several points during this time span he would pick his bowel movement out of the plastic bag and begin getting sexually recharged again. During the course of this behavior he would fantasize being with a "really beautiful young girl" who had "long hair and a pretty face" and who "also liked long, soft, beautiful oozie-goozies".</p>
<p class="calibre1">This man worked as a high school biology teacher, and had earned an M.S. in his discipline. In spite of his unusual behavior and fantasy life, he appeared to be in sufficiently adequate contact with reality to be able to competently handle his job. Thus, he had regularly maintained his coprophiliac interests, fantasies and behaviors throughout his life, and had been having orgasms inspired by the holding of beautiful "oozie-goozies" since his earliest teen years. His unhappiness issued from his being totally without female companionship as well as from certain obvious inconveniences which his sexual penchant had created for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, he had always been afraid to go to the toilet at work or at school for fear that he might "take an unusually beautiful oozie-goozie" while he was away from home, and thus suffer "severe sexual trauma" because he might not be able to "pick it up and fondle it."</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>334 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Fending Off Unwanted Overtures</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As extremely passive people, some of the loveshy men had had difficulties in fending off homosexual strangers who had wanted to become involved in sexmaking activity. None of the respondents had ever been to bed with a homosexual. But several had experienced difficulties on busses or subways or in other public places. Typically an overly aggressive homosexual would (1) misperceive the loveshy man as being a homosexual, and (2) that overly aggressive homosexual would persistently move his hand onto the loveshy man's crotch area. Rather than becoming sexually excited by this, the loveshys would characteristically become extremely nervous and upset. They would perceive the overly aggressive homosexual as "just another aggressive, extrovert bully", and they would change seats or make some concerted effort to just get away from him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In at least one situation recounted by a 20-year old loveshy man, getting away was not so easy to accomplish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, this happened during the week between the end of the spring quarter and the beginning of the summer quarter. I didn't want to go home because I figured it just wouldn't be worth it for only one week. So I stayed in the dormitory. Anyway, one night I left the student union building after having some refreshments, and I started walking back to my dorm room. All of a sudden this guy comes up to me and starts acting really friendly. He said he had just come down here from Eugene, Oregon, and was lonely and wanted to meet some people. There was something about him I didn't like; but I couldn't put my finger on anything except his very hoarse, raspy voice. I had often been lonely myself; so I didn't want to seem unfriendly. Anyway, he invited himself into my dorm room, and everything was okay for the first fifteen minutes or so. But then he asks me to remove one of my shoes. I thought that was a strange request, but I did it for him. And he held the shoe up really close to his eyes. I thought he was straining to read something in it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, next he asks me to take my socks off; and then I knew something was fishy! All of a sudden he rushes down and takes my socks off. He holds them up to his nose real hard. And I was shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know what to say or do. Then he grabs my foot and holds that real hard up to his nose and puts it in his mouth! I start screaming; but I was really worried because I knew there weren't many people around who could hear me. This guy starts grabbing me and trying to force me on to my bed. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to grab for the door knob, and I managed to get it open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By that time the guy had ejaculated, and you could see all this stuff staining right through his pants. He had so much nerve! Believe me,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy 335</p>
<p class="calibre1">that wasn't the end of him. He tried to get into my room on three more occasions before I finally saw the last of him. I mean he would stand outside my door sometimes for an hour at a time asking me to let him smell my feet. I couldn't even leave my room to take a leak because he'd be standing out there trying to get at my feet!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Being Misperceived as Homosexual</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 97 percent of the older loveshy men and 58 percent of the younger ones claimed that they were often mistakingly perceived by people as being homosexual. For many of the older loveshys this misconstrual was an almost daily occurrence. People who saw them regularly would begin to notice that they are never with anybody. As a result of never being seen in the company of a woman, acquaintances in their apartment building or dormitory would begin to suspect homosexuality; and some of these people would occasionally become quite overt in the manifestation of their suspicions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">University students who never date and are never seen in the company of women are often publicly labeled "fag". And there are evidently many people of both sexes who automatically assume that any man remaining unmarried and without the companionship of a woman past the age of 30, must be homosexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys interviewed for this book could remember receiving a steady barrage of ego-castigating name-calling from the time they were young children in the earliest years of elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many young children use such disparaging names as "fag" and "queer"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and "fairy" and "faggot" without even knowing what the literal denotations and meanings of such words are. And many of the loveshys could vividly remember hearing these words shouted at them when they were merely eight or nine years old.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, nonconforming children of the male sex receive all sorts of verbal hazing and name calling. However, even when the loveshys grew old enough to learn the true meaning of some of these disparaging labels, they never thought seriously for any length of time that they might actually be a homosexual. To most of the loveshys, being labeled a "homosexual" was nothing more than just one more reflection of the fact that no one truly understood them or appreciated them, or were even willing to try. Furthermore, some of the loveshys perceived these false labels as merely reflecting the gross stupidity that they saw as being characteristic of all bullies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many sociologists believe that a consistent exposure over a long period of time to a particular disparaging labelâ€”such as "homo" or "fag"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>336 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">or "fairy"â€”will result in the internalization of that label, and the consequent transformation of the labeled person's self-image. According to this theory a teenager who is frequently labeled a "fag" by many different people on a daily basis should in time actually become a "fag"; and he should begin behaving like a "fag" with all of a normal fag's sexual predilections and fantasies. This quite popular <i class="calibre4"> labeling theory</i> obviously did not prove valid for any of the 300 heterosexual loveshys who were studied for this book. And the fact that all of the disparaging homosexual labeling had failed to have any effect (in terms of creating a desire to experiment with homosexual behavior) provides a strong argument in support of the proposition that true homosexuality is <i class="calibre4"> inborn.2</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshys simply ignored the majority of the name-calling to which they had been subjected during their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As children physical bullying had bothered them a great deal more than verbal hazing. But presently as adults most of the loveshys were very much bothered by the quiet whisperings and intimations behind their backs that they are homosexually inclined. To the loveshy men these whisperings and negative glances represented proof that they had no real control over the way they were "playing themselves" on the great</p>
<p class="calibre1">"stage" of life. It represented proof that they were not <i class="calibre4"> commanding their</i> <i class="calibre4">performance</i> in accordance with their wishes, values and desiresâ€”that they were not now and never had been truly in the <i class="calibre4"> driver's seat</i> of their own lives and destinies.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in this way the loveshys felt themselves to be worse off than most homosexuals. In manifesting a homosexual ambiance, most homosexuals are only being true to themselves. To be sure, in American society there is a heavy price to be paid for being a homosexual. But a true homosexual can at least pay the price (if he <i class="calibre4"> must</i> pay it) with the knowledge in mind that he is at least playing his "true self" in the "drama of life". In stark contrast to the homosexual, the heterosexual loveshy man (especially after he passes the age of 30) is often required to <i class="calibre4"> pay the price</i> for being something that he is not. In short, he often has to pay some of the price of being a homosexual (1) even though he knows he is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> a homosexual, and (2) without being able to enjoy any of the rewards and emotional securities that come with being (and accepting oneself as) a homosexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Being Misperceived By Homosexuals</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as loveshy men are often misperceived as homosexuals by heterosexual men, a great many of them are also misperceived as homosexual by homosexual men. Many of the loveshys spoke of having been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>The Sexual Lives of the LoveShy  3 3 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">frequently importuned or befriended by homosexual men. This must evidently happen quite a bit on university campuses because the younger loveshys seemed to have the greatest number of stories to share. And most of the situations that had happened to the older loveshys had similarly occurred during their days as university students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">None of the situations the loveshys shared with me had been traumatic or seriously anxiety-provoking. There are evidently very few overly aggressive homosexuals. In fact, most of the homosexuals discussed in the interviews had simply wanted to make a friend. And in approaching a lonely, loveshy heterosexual, the homosexuals had doubtless believed that they were approaching someone who belonged to their element. Of course, some of these homosexual men may not have been specifically after sex as their major goal. Some of them may simply have noticed areas of conspicuously similar interests (e.g., music, the arts, etc.) between themselves and the loveshy heterosexual men they approached in an effort to befriend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, there was this one guy I really felt sorry for. This happened three years ago when I was a freshman. I was really innocent then.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know anything. Like now I would certainly know that this guy was a homosexual. But at the time this occurred, the very idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">'homosexual' had never even crossed my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, this guy always ate alone in the dorm dining hall. And I always ate alone too. One day he came up to me and asked to join me. And I was only too happy to ask him to sit down with me. He seemed like a nice guy; and we had a lot of interests in common. Like, he went to the movies a lot, and we both liked the same kinds of music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, after chatting with him several times in the dining hall, he invited me to go out to dinner with him. He was a senior; and even though he obviously wasn't popular, I was still flattered. So I went.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, about half way through the meal he brings up his sexual preference. I was really dumbfounded because, like I told you, I had never heard very much about homosexuals, and I certainly had never met one before. I mean, he wasn't pushy or anything. Like I said, he was really a nice guy. I really felt sorry for him because he obviously was lonely just like I was. I remember he was really surprised and sort of incredulous when I told him that I didn't know what he meant when he said he was a homosexual. He was really surprised that I wasn't a homosexual because he said that I showed all the signs. But like I told him about how I had always dreamed about being with a girl, ever since I was a first grade kid in elementary school. I mean, being with a girl was my constant preoccupation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I remember feeling guilty because I was dreaming about being with a girl even as I was eating dinner with him! I shared my feelings with him about how I was always dreaming about certain girls on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>3 3 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">campus whom I admired, and about how extremely shy I was. And I remember how he said that he was bored and could not relate to that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, he said he was shy too. And he realized after all I had told him about myself that I really couldn't be a homosexual. Anyway, I offered to be his friend, but that I'd never be able to do anything sexual with him. Actually, I was somewhat surprised when he rather coldly turned me down. He told me that in view of my overwhelmingly strong interest in girls that it would really be better if we didn't see each other again. He asked me to keep our conversation strictly confidential. I remember that because he seemed rather concerned about it. Anyway, I agreed because I did feel sympathy for his position. And I didn't have any friends anyway I could go jabbering to. I saw him a lot in the dining hall after that. But we never again chatted. And he never even responded when I said 'hi' to him in the hallways." (22-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, not all of the loveshys abstained from friendships with homosexuals. In fact, the relatively few loveshys who had any meaningful friendships at all quite typically claimed that their best friend was a homosexual, or that they had enjoyed meaningful but quite non-romantic friendships with homosexuals in the past. In these cases there had never been any sexual interaction with the homosexual friend inasmuch as the latter had been fully capable of respecting the loveshy man's heterosexual tastes. However, in most cases these friendships gradually tapered off and died out without any ado. The following is typical of this pattern:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"For about three years my only real friend was a homosexual. Don't laugh, but I didn't even know he was homosexual until about two years into our friendship. We would always be going to movies and shows together, and when he moved away we corresponded regularly for about a year. I've visited his home a lot of times; and I always enjoyed listening to records with him. We both like Broadway show music; and both of us have large collections of really good show albums, many of which have been out of print for years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, he finally confessed his homosexual instincts one night when we were in the apartment of this friend of his listening to out-of-print show albums. He kissed the guy on the lips several times with me right there watching. And after we left he discussed the situation. I told him there was no way I could practice any homosexual behavior. I told him that I didn't consider it sinful or wrong or anything like thatâ€”but that I was just emotionally turned off by it. Anyway, he said he had realized what my feelings were ever since he had first met me, but that he'd really like it if we could still be friends. As for myself, I liked him and I couldn't see any point</p>

I remember he could play the piano by ear, and I really envied him for that. I sometimes used to spend hours just watching him play the piano. But I'd always be dreaming that I was the one who was playing, and that there was a really beautiful girl there with me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, after a while I started going more and more into my shell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew I wasn't being my real self. I never actually broke up with Kevin. I just stopped answering his lettersâ€”not because he's a homosexual. That part didn't bother me. If I had had a girl friend I was close to I would have done my damnedest to sustain my friendship with him because I really liked him and we shared a lot of interests.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I wasn't being my real self without a girl friend. And I knew I didn't want to be friends with anybody of my own sex until after I had found a girlfriend I could be close to.

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">On Envying Homosexuals</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though none of the loveshys had any homosexual inclinations, almost half of them indicated that from time to time they felt quite envious of homosexual men and women. To be sure, they did not envy them for their sexual life styles and predilections; indeed, the mere thought of engaging in or even observing any homosexual activity revolted the 300 loveshy men with whom I spoke. What the loveshys did envy about homosexuals is that <i class="calibre4"> homosexuals have a place to go. </i> And they are a recognized social category and a political force, whereas heterosexual loveshys are not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are innumerable "gay" social organizations, support groups,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gay" bars, "gay" baths, "gay" newspapers and magazines, and indeed even "gay" apartment complexes and "gay" clothing stores! In addition to all of these resources, the homosexual community incorporates numerous legal and psychotherapeutic organizations where free or quite inexpensive help can be obtained, and through which <i class="calibre4"> meaningful companionship with like minds</i> can be experienced and enjoyed. Indeed, many of the larger cities today even provide "gay" churches headed by "gay"</p>
<p class="calibre1">clergymen.</p>
