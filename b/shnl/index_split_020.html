<p class="calibre1">This type of "day care center for dogs" arrangement, if it could be made sufficiently widespread to meet the demand, could greatly facilitate and expand opportunities for meaningful heterosexual interaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, social programs could also be offered. Some of these could involve dogs (e.g., discussion groups concerning grooming, dog contests, etc.), and some could involve dances and partiesâ€”featuring</p>
<p class="calibre1">"middle-of-the-road" piano music by such greats as Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Jule Styne, Frank Loesser, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshys (and indeed all singles) have long had to deal with an unnaturally antiseptic attitude among landlords. There are still far too many apartment buildings wherein people with dogs <i class="calibre4"> and with human</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p615"></a>5 8 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">children</i> are not welcomed. People who don't want dogs or children should not be forced to live with them. But the proportion of buildings not permitting dogs and/or children is <i class="calibre4"> at least three times greater</i> than the number of apartment renters who do not wish to reside in a building with dogs and/or human children. Because apartment owners and landlords command financial wherewithall, they have for too long been permitted to have the last word. Segregation of the age groups and of animals from man is known not to be good for optimal mental health. In a mentally healthy society money would never be permitted to be the determining factor in courts of law as to what is good, right, best, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that universities could take a lead role here in developing communities which the rest of society could emulate. For comparatively little money, virtually all large universities could set aside a fenced in area for dogs. Thus, by expanding opportunities in areas wherein the loveshy have always maintained strong interests (e.g., dogs, psychic and occult subjects, Broadway show music, motion pictures and dramatics, travel, love ballad music, etc.), university and community leaders can do much to both prevent and cure severe loveshyness. This is especially true if some benevolent coercion (tactfully effected) is employed to involve loveshy males, and if concerted efforts are made to assure <i class="calibre4">at least</i> a 50-50 sex ratio at all events. (Ideally, there should always be at least a few more girls on hand than young men.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final point, the following dog breeds are particularly recommended for the loveshy. Thus, it may not be feasible for interested universities to breed all the different kinds of dogs. My experience has taught me that the following <i class="calibre4"> 12</i> breeds represent the most prudent selections from the standpoint of the loveshy: Standard Poodles; Golden Retrievers; Laborador Retrievers; Airedale Terriors; Irish Terriers; Irish Setters; Afgan Hounds; Collies; Old English Sheepdogs; Siberian Huskies; Dalmations; and Wirehaired Fox Terriers. To be avoided are the toy breeds, the superlarge breeds, the aggressive "guard dog" breeds, and breeds of all sizes with asymmetrical body proportions (e.g., overly short legs; turned-in snouts; overly large heads, etc.), and other ugly, unesthetic characteristics. In general, the more conspicuously attractive and exuberant a breed is, the better that breed is likely to be for the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Universities might also consider breeding pygmy chimpanzees, wooley monkeys, capuchin monkeys, and spider monkeys, as these animals also seem to hold considerable appeal for the loveshy. As recent segments on the CBS news magazine "60 Minutes" have demonstrated, some of these species of monkeys are extremely intelligent. They can be taught to spoon feed the elderly and paraplegic patients, do minor household chores, fetch things, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Coeducational Dormitories: Their Limitations</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The research literature published up to now on the subject of coeducational dormitories is bound to be perceived by a majority of loveshy men as highly demoralizing and disheartening. Only 15 percent of university students resident in coed dorms ever develop love relationships with opposite sexed residents of their own dorms. And this 15 percent represents a figure worth remembering because it has cropped up in several different studies. In essence, the lion's share of coed dorm residents do not fall in love with fellow dorm residents. If a dormitory resident falls in love at all while he/she is residing in a dormitory, it will usually be with someone who lives outside of his/her dorm. Dormitory residents come to perceive their opposed-sexed fellows in "brother-sister"</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms. Thus, there appears to be a transfer of the incest taboo. And strangely enough, this "transfer" is quite often supported by the informal norms which develop among the young people themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This quite formidable limitation of coed dormitory life must be recognized at the outset by both loveshys and psychotherapists alike.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshyness is an excruciatingly painful condition, and there is no room for delusions when it comes to matters pertinent to its treatment. My data make it very clear that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> loveshy men desperately want just one emotionally close companion of the opposite sex; and they want this more strongly than they want anything else. And I believe that attaining this goal for them represents the <i class="calibre4"> first and most important</i> therpaeutic goal <i class="calibre4">of the immediate moment. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The coed dormitory will not secure for the loveshys what they most strongly need and crave. However, I believe that a coeducational dorm living experience can and usually will serve some other very useful therapeutic purposes. And I believe that these purposes can be served without in any way slowing down the speed with which the loveshy man can be helped to obtain a meaningful love relationship in which he can enmesh himself. We are living in a coeducational world. And there is evidence that men need coeducation a great deal more than women do. There clearly would be no useful purpose served by returning to the days of the gender-segregated type of dormitory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the major findings of the research upon which this book is based was that the self-confident non-shys were <i class="calibre4"> five times as likely as the</i> <i class="calibre4">loveshys</i> to have grown up in homes with female siblings. Simply put, merely having an opposite-sexed sibling appears to operate as a major deterrent to the development of chronic and intractable loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Inasmuch as fellow residents of coeducational dormitories are commonly perceived in brother-sister terms, the experience of living in a coed dormitory and of eating in coeducational situations may facilitate (1) the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p617"></a>5 8 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability to feel at ease around the opposite sex, and (2) it may facilitate relaxed, informal, cross-sexed communication. It doesn't always work out this way. In many coeducational dorms the men and women still seem to gravitate towards eating at gender-segregated tables. Nevertheless, the available research evidence on coed dorms indicates that things are improving, and that casual heterosexual interaction is facilitated by the experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, there is one thing which residence in a coeducational dorm will <i class="calibre4"> not</i> do: it will not solve the loveshy man's problem of inability to initiate conversations with members of the opposite sex (or with <i class="calibre4"> anybody, </i> for that matter); it will not enable a loveshy man to suddenly become assertive in a friendly, cordial and congenial sort of way. And it will not stop him from perceiving friendliness as "requiring a great deal of nerve".</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is possible for a person to spend four years in a coeducational dormitory and never informally socialize with members of the opposite sex. Fully 54 percent of the younger loveshys had resided in coeducational dormitories. And all preferred coed dorms to the gender segregated option. But not a single one of this 54 percent had ever even</p>
<p class="calibre1">"come close" to making any opposite-sexed friends throughout the entirety of their residence in coed dorms. And most of the time they just ate alone at a table off somewhere in an isolated corner of the dining hall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, loveshy men absolutely require a series of strong catalysts for the facilitation of frequent, informal heterosexual interaction. Dormitories do not provide such catalysts; and without them the loveshy will make no therapeutic gains at all. In essence, therapists must engineer ways of catalyzing informal heterosexual interaction. Again, I believe that practice-dating therapy offers by far the best promise in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men should be strongly encouraged to live in coeducational housing while they are involved in practice-dating therapy. But this coeducational housing should be regarded as <i class="calibre4"> a very minor therapeutic adjunct, </i> and nothing more. The <i class="calibre4"> real and central</i> therapeutic modality must be that of practice-dating therapy acting in concert with membership in a coeducational Shys Anonymous mutual support and self-help group.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The "Harrad" Dormitory Option</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the next 200 to 300 years, I believe that all incoming freshmen college students will be routeinely paired up with a coeducational roommate. In 1966, Robert H. Rimmer published a pedagogic novel entitled THE HARRAD EXPERIMENT, which sold somewhere in excess</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p618"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 8 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">of five million copies. In addition, two motion pictures were made which were based rather loosely on the novel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today the idea of routeinely pairing young people off with opposite-sexed roommates whom they've never met before appears inordinately controversial to most people. However, insofar as our world is a <i class="calibre4"> coeducational</i> one, the idea of opposite sexed roommates may actually be far more "natural" than the idea of same-sexed roommatesâ€”except, of course, for true homosexuals who would certainly do far better living with other true homosexuals as roommates. Further, there is no reason to assume that any particular pair of male/female roommates will necessarily decide to have sex; they might in time decide to have it, and then again they might not.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally, I cannot think of any better way to prevent severe and chronic loveshyness from developing in the first place than to provide a program of coeducational roommates for all college and university studentsâ€”excepting homosexuals and religious fundamentalists. As is the case now with same-sexed roommates, incompatible roommates would be separated, and each would be assigned to a new, more suitable roommate. Over the course of a four-year college career, the typical student might experience living with as many as six or seven different opposite-sexed roommates. And many romances as well as many marriages might well develop from these relationships. But most importantly, I believe that some genuine, lifelong <i class="calibre4"> friendships</i> would develop from them. Right now cross-sexed friendships are very rare in our society. I think that with the onset of widespread "Harrad-type" dormitories, such friendships would become far more prevalent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the experience of growing up in the same house with a sister, I think that having an opposite-sexed roommate would (1) remove the aura of mystery and anxiety surrounding the other sex, and (2) it would enable each young person to more easily perceive the other sex as just regular human beings like themselves. Some people don't seem to like the idea of "removing the aura of mystery". I very much approve of the idea because wherever you find an "aura of mystery", you also find fear, social distance, misunderstandings, and deficits of communication.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think we can all do without such "auras of mystery". Indeed, I think we can all do a whole lot better without them!</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Harrad-styled" coeducational roommate approach is fundamentally very different from the notion of premarital cohabitation. In premarital cohabitation a young man and woman with an already established love-relationship "live together" as an integral part of their courtship. (Remember, courtship is a screening device for marriage and the family. Thus, premarital cohabitation is in no way competitive with the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p619"></a>5 8 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">institutions of marriage and the family.) With "Harrad-styled" coed room mates, there is no romantic or sexual interest <i class="calibre4"> at the outset. </i> Such might develop in many cases; and when it does the couple might be deemed to be "premaritally cohabitating"â€”which is fine. But until each young man or woman finds "that special someone", the experience of residing with an opposite-sexed roommate is bound to be far more educational than the traditional experience of residing with a same-sexed roommate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As happened with most of the roommate pairs in Rimmer's THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">HARRAD EXPERIMENT, sexual intimacy (including coitus) was experienced within the context of friendship (i.e., non-romantic) relationships. Most of the couples required between six and eight weeks of living together as roommates before they became involved sexually. As birth control was effectively practiced by allâ€”as per the Harrad regulations, no harm and only good came out of these sexual liaisons. For example, through having sex on many occasions with different roommates of the opposite sex, each person (1) developed an increasingly favorable social self-confidence, (2) gained increasing self-knowledge; (3) became increasingly realistic about male-female relationships; (4) developed a significantly better understanding of the opposite sex; and (5) became a far better lover than he/she would have been without having had the coed roommate experience. Thus, as in preliterate societies, as a result of having had a series of opposite-sexed roommates, each young man and woman becomes a far better partner and lover vis-a-vis his/her selected love-mate, than he/she would have been without the experience.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Would the "Harrad-styled" dormitory breed lifelong promiscuity?</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have heard it said that whereas the loveshy might benefit enormously from this approach, more outgoing young people might well find it difficult to remain faithful to one lifelong partner. However, the evidence from hundreds of societies around the world suggests that <i class="calibre4"> most</i> human beings become quite psychoemotionally monogamous after they reach the age of 24 or 25. In point of fact, adultery is a great deal more rare in sexually permissive (re: <i class="calibre4"> premarital</i> sex) societies than it is here in the United States. And the evidence at our disposal strongly suggests that better than 85 percent of all young people would gravitate in due course towards a lifelong commitment to just one lover and marriage partner. Indeed, many anthropologists believe that when the Harrad-styled dormitory becomes fully institutionalized in American society we will enjoy a much more stable marriage and family life than we enjoy today. Again, the sexes will <i class="calibre4"> understand</i> both themselves and each other a great deal better than they do today.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p620"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 8 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, none of this is likely to commence happening with any rate of speed until approximately the year 2200. On the other hand, in the year 1950 no one would have dreamed that the decades of the 1960s and 1970s would bring forth as much social change as indeed happened during those decades. Harrad-styled dormitories under private auspices could be developed <i class="calibre4"> now, </i> especially near campuses with top quality students from stable, upper-middle class, professional homes. And I would strongly recommend that this be done. The present trend in religion is away from the more fundamentalistic Christian approach, and towards a more spiritualistic philosophy and approach. This can be seen in the burgeoning popularity of such subjects as "life after life", the work of such people as Raymond Moody, Jr., and Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, "out-of-the-body" experiences, extra-sensory (psi) perception, apparitions, psychic healing, psychic surgery, Kirlian photography, acupuncture, the human aura, reincarnation, the effects of meditation and biofeedback upon the body, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> If this trend continues, and I very definitely believe that it will, then by the year 2200 (and possibly a great deal sooner) there will be a religious basis for <i class="calibre4"> in good conscience</i> supporting Harrad-styled dormitories as well as premarital cohabitation generally.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Psychic Healing of Important Enzymes</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is likely that most chronic illness and pathology is at least partially rooted in malfunctioning enzymes. And as I suggested earlier in this book, this appears to be as true for chronic shyness and inhibition as it is for various forms of cancer, heart disease, arthritis, Altzheimer's disease, and hundreds of other scourges of mankind. What is more, there appears to be a vicious cycle operating here. Just as a malfunctioning enzyme may cause severe inhibition, the <i class="calibre4"> anxiety-ridden states of mind</i> which are associated with chronic people-phobia may themselves operate to "neutralize and disorder" certain crucial enzymes. For example, we know that people who recover from cancer possess much more optimism, much more of a <i class="calibre4"> "will to live" </i>, than those who do not recover.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We also know that not having any purely selfish personal goals similarly predisposes people to come down with cases of terminal cancer. In short, psychoemotional states of mind do have a profound impact upon the body. And much of this impact is upon enzyme activity which is indispensable for catalyzing a whole host of metabolic activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Justa Smith, a biochemist at Rosery Hill College, has found that enzymes react very strongly to the "laying on of hands" by <i class="calibre4"> quality</i> psychic healers. More importantly, she found that formerly disordered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p621"></a>5 9 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">or malfunctioning enzymes are quite quickly rendered fully healthy and functional in this way. Dr. Smith's findings have been strongly corroborated by Dr. Bernard Grad and his staff of the biochemistry department at McGill University in Montreal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point there is no way of knowing whether the "laying on of hands" (psi healing) would work effectively upon the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, some careful research efforts along these lines are definitely warrented. A most promising line of research might be to systematically apply psychic healing <i class="calibre4"> (by reputable healers)</i> to the heads of 3-to 7-year old male children who withdraw from "rough and tumble" play. If that works with any degree of success, similar psychic healing could be performed on young adult loveshys. Scientists in East Germany have achieved considerable success in the masculinizing of socially withdrawn young boys; but they have relied primarily upon hormone therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of injecting young boys with masculinizing hormones, the curing of malfunctioning enzymes (thus permitting hormones already in the blood stream to work) via psychic healing might well prove to be an easier and far more "natural" solution.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It should be remembered that a neutralized or disordered enzyme is one which is effectively prevented from enabling a hormone to do its job upon appropriate tissues in the brain. As I pointed out in chapter six, there is evidence that a pregnant mother's state of mind can serve to effectively disable certain masculinizing hormones in a male fetus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key shortcoming of contemporary empirical science has been its aversion to research on psychic and occult subjects. To be sure, not all scientists are biased against this area of scholarly inquiry. Indeed, an ever increasing number of scholars, especially in quantum physics, are becoming quite actively involved with the researching of occult subjects.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, a sufficiently high proportion of university scientists who are in charge of (1) funding, and (2) promotion and tenure decisions, are irrationally and blindly biased against research in this field. I believe that these reactionary academics have served to greatly impede the evolution of knowledge, of effective treatment programs, and of a better way of life for all people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, I believe that these biased scholars are guilty of ignoring one of the most important of all scientific laws: namely, that an <i class="calibre4"> open</i> <i class="calibre4">mind</i> must be sustained until facts are presented which contraindicate a particular principle. These scientists and their pig-headed attitudes must be fought hard. And it is my hope that within the next few decades all major universities throughout the United States will have initiated a separate academic department which will be called "department of psychic and occult studies".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p622"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 9 1</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Effect of Increasing Social Interaction</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Any increase in activity will almost always serve to stave off depression. Many therapists believe that shy people must be prodded to increase their activity level and their amount and frequency of informal social interaction. They believe that shy people ought to be distracted as strongly as possible from their enormously strong need and preoccupation about finding an intimateâ€”an emotionally close friend and confidant of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sociologists Marjorie Lowenthal and Clayton Haven (1968) collected some fascinating data which have a strong bearing upon this issue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They divided a large sample of elderly people (63 years of age and older) into two different groups: (1) those who had <i class="calibre4"> increased</i> their amount and frequency of informal social interaction, and (2) those whose rate of informal social interaction had <i class="calibre4"> decreased. </i> They then in turn divided <i class="calibre4"> both</i> of these groups by whether the person did or did not have a <i class="calibre4"> confidant. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A "confidant" was defined as any person upon whom the individual could depend for close, intimate friendship and emotionally meaningful psychological support. For most people a "confidant" is normally represented by a spouse or an opposite-sexed lover/friend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowenthal and Haven's findings revealed that the presence or absence of a confidant in a person's life makes far greater difference from the standpoint of depression, psychoemotional health, and <i class="calibre4"> medical</i> symptomology, than does the fact of merely increasing the amount or frequency of informal social interaction. In short, having a lot of casual friends and acquaintances can benefit a person's morale. But such interaction will not make anywhere nearly as much of a positive impact upon a person's physical or mental health as will the sheer fact of having an emotionally close friend and intimate upon whom he can count for love and psychological support.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is clear that if you have a confidant, you can decrease your social interaction and run no greater risk of becoming depressed than if you had increased it. Further, if you have no confidant, you may increase your social activities and yet be far more likely to be depressed than the individual who has a confidant but has <i class="calibre4"> lowered</i> his interaction level. Finally, if you have no confidant and retrench in your social life, the odds for depression become overwhelming." (Lowenthal and Haven, 1968, p. 26)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowenthal and Haven further found that <i class="calibre4"> single, never married men</i> were the least likely to have a confidant of all major categories of people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only 36 percent of them were classified as having a confidant, compared to 74 percent of married men, 50 percent of separated, divorced and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p623"></a>5 9 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">widowed men, 67 percent of "single, never married" women, and 81</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of married women. "Single, never married" males are a good deal less likely than other groups to have a normally healthy capacity for intimacy. Because of their "trained incapacity" for intimacy, they are much more vulnerable than other groups to a wide variety of health problems and to a short longevity. Having a confidant and a viable capacity for intimacy has been found to very significantly buffer all of the stresses and strains, trials and tribulations of everyday living. In addition, there is mounting evidence that <i class="calibre4"> not</i> having a confidant is itself a very major life stressor that can ultimately cause the development of a wide variety of chronic diseases and disorders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that Lowenthal and Haven's data support my basic premise that the first and primary task of any therapist treating loveshy men is to promote (1) the finding of an opposite-sexed lover and confidant, and (2) to promote a capacity for intimacy. And I believe that these two goals can only be successfully pursued through practice-dating therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, helping a person to expand his network of friendships <i class="calibre4"> is</i> a desirable goal. But it should not be pursued until <i class="calibre4"> after</i> the far more important <i class="calibre4"> presenting problem</i> of the need for an opposite-sexed lover and confidant has been solved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A man cannot truly <i class="calibre4"> become himself</i> with another man unless and until he has a woman. In that sense, a loveshy man cannot and will not commence working upon the expansion of his friendship network unless and until he has found his female confidant and lover. To place friendships before opposite-sexed confidants is tantamount to placing the cart before the horse. Most loveshy men realize this. And that is one reason why few of them will cooperate with a therapist who arrogantly tries to tell his/her client what he/she ought to want, and what he/she ought to begin working on before the presenting problem of a need for a lover can be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowenthal and Haven's findings hold some important implications from the standpoint of prevention. For example, the having of a genuine intimate/confidant throughout one's formative years can probably do more to prevent the development of severe loveshyness than having a large network of same-sexed friends. During the years of childhood that intimate/confidant might usually be the mother. This is especially true for boys from psychologically healthy families. As the person moves through the years of adolescence, to an increasing extent the field of significant confidantes would include girlfriends. The key point is that to the extent a male child or adolescent has these intimates and confidantes throughout his years of growing up, to that extent he is never likely to become severely loveshy. It should be noted that a caring mother is <i class="calibre4"> not necessarily</i> going to be an intimate/confidant to her son. In</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p624"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 9 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">order for her to qualify as an intimate and true confidant vis-a-vis her son she must have a warm and meaningful relationship with her son.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She must be perceived by him as being (1) approachable, and (2) always emotionally relaxing and enjoyable to be with.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The High School Curriculum</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most American high schools maintain a very rigid curriculum. A rigid educational philosophy is almost always counterproductive inasmuch as it is fundamentally insensitive to basic human needs and differences. Worst of all, it results in the wasting of a great deal of valuable time. By the time children reach their junior high school years, cases of incipient, chronic loveshyness are virtually always conspicuously evident. There is much that public education can do to reverse the development of loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Foreign Languages</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many educators strongly defend the view that all high school students should take two years of a foreign language. I would suggest that for those students who are too shy to assert themselves in a friendly, relaxed, sociable way <i class="calibre4"> in their native English language, </i> it is downright ludicrous and absurd in the extreme to require the cognitive mastery of some other language. The ability to enjoy normal social intercourse <i class="calibre4"> in</i> <i class="calibre4">one's own tongue</i> should precede any foreign language study. If a child is too shy to properly assert himself in the English language, how the hell can he logically be expected to do so in some other language!?</p>
<p class="calibre1">To a greater extent than the large majority of young people, the shy and inhibited require education <i class="calibre4"> which they can use</i> both now and in the future. They require an education that is germane to the <i class="calibre4"> developmental</i> <i class="calibre4">tasks</i> which, compared to their age-mates, they are exceptionally slow in even attempting to accomplish. Foreign languages are of relevance to neither the socioemotional nor the vocational developmental tasks of the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">History and Civics</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The ostensible purpose of requiring history and civics courses is that of cultivating in young people a sense of responsibility for participating in the affairs of their respective communities. Civics, in particular,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p625"></a>5 9 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">is intended to foster a deep sense of appreciation for America's democratic heritage. And it is intended to assure that all young people will want to study the issues that affect the community <i class="calibre4"> and vote. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a curious paradox that very few of the loveshy men I interviewed had received grades lower than <i class="calibre4"> "A" </i> or <i class="calibre4"> "B" </i> in their high school and college civics/history courses. Yet as my research data show, very few loveshy males ever vote. Moreover, very few of the loveshy males I studied felt themselves to be a part of the respective communities in which they resided.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More succinctly, for loveshy males neither the taking of history/</p>
<p class="calibre1">civics courses nor the attaining of high grades in such courses seems to be associated with voting or with any kind of meaningful civic participation. On the other hand, (1) <i class="calibre4"> NON-SHYNESS, </i> (2) <i class="calibre4"> social self-confidence,</i> <i class="calibre4">and</i> (3) active involvement and participation in a network of meaningful friendships, have all been found to be HIGHLY ASSOCIATED with VOTING and with responsible participation in the democratic governance of community affairs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, if a school district wishes to maximize the chances that its students will vote when they come of age, they would do far better to (1) teach interpersonal skills, (2) cure all cases of loveshyness, and (3) make sure that all of their students enjoy respected and meaningful participation within peer groups composed of trusted, well-liked friends of both sexes. The cognative, intellectual skills/knowledge which might be accumulated through the study of academic history and civics courses simply will not accomplish this goal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Academic courses in history and civics may be all well and good for the majority of non-shy young people who already enjoy a respected place amid a network of friends. For the shy and inhibited, on the other hand, I recommend practice-dating therapy and interpersonal skills building classes in lieu of academic work in history and civics. Such would represent a far more prudent and judicious use of school time and of psychointellectual energies. Further, there is a copious abundance of time at the college and university level during which academic courses in history and civics can be taken by the shy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Literature Courses</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that all students need to be taught how to competently and effectively express themselves in both the spoken and the written word. However, there is no way that requiring all students to read and master such books as THE SCARLET LETTER, IVANHOE, THE RED</p>
<p class="calibre1">BADGE OF COURAGE, GIANTS IN THE EARTH, SILAS MARNER, TREASURE ISLAND, etc., can logically be considered germane to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p626"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention 595</p>
<p class="calibre1">effective attainment of this end. Such fictional works as the foregoing have for some inexplicable reason remained intractably welded to high school curricula for well over a century. No one has ever empirically demonstrated (through a controlled research study) the benefit of these works for normal high school young people, much less for the highly inhibited, loveshy ones. Moreover, such literary works could not be more irrelevant to the necessary, highly pressing developmental tasks and psychoemotional needs of youths with deficits in interpersonal skills and social self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such traditional literary works as the foregoing can also give students a misguided idea of their writing ability. For example, how can a loveshy boy compose a theme about 1VANHOE when every page of such a war mongering work bores him to tears?! How can a loveshy person write about a book that contains absolutely no characters with whom he can identify?! Most loveshy boys want to read love stories.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Works such as ROMEO AND JULIET, LORNA DOONE, TRISTAN AND</p>
<p class="calibre1">ISAULD, and TOM SAWYER, go over well with loveshys because there is a boy/girl romance in each of these works. Until such time as a loveshy male acquires a meaningful boy/girl romance of his own, I strongly suspect that boy/girl romances are likely to constitute the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> type of fiction upon which he will be able to concentrate for any length of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as boy/girl romance represents a major fixture of a loveshy boy's wish-fulfillment daydreams, a loveshy boy is likely to relish any novel, short story or motion picture which deals with a boy/girl love affair.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A forced exposure to such works as IVANHOE, THE SCARLET</p>
<p class="calibre1">LETTER, etc., may further cause many young people (especially the loveshy) to associate the idea of reading <i class="calibre4"> any</i> work of fiction with feelings of intense displeasure. For the duller students it may cause <i class="calibre4"> reading itself</i> to become associated with feelings of displeasure. Parenthetically, most of the loveshys I studied for this book did a great deal of reading. But their reading was confinedâ€”almost exclusively to non-fiction. However, I noticed that many of them had popular romance novels strewn about their apartments. Thus, a significant minority of loveshy men would appear to spend quite a bit of their time reading popular love and romance novels.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, if the hours which high school students are required to be involved in the study of foreign languages, history, civics, literary works, and physical education, were to be tallied up, the sum total would doubtless be remarkably high. To be sure, most of these activities may well prove at least somewhat beneficial for a majority of high school aged young people. But for students who are loveshy social isolates, these many hundreds of school and homework hours should be used for what is of far, far greater importance.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p627"></a>596 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the loveshy should be involved in practice-dating therapy programs, assertiveness training programs, interpersonal skills development programs, and other related endeavors. Such activities will not only benefit loveshy young people far, far more pervasively than the less-than-indispensable academic courses and the enormously loathed</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rough and tumble" physical education, but they will also assure that the loveshy will acquire the skills and the psychoemotional set that they need to become integrated members of their local communities.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Ballroom Dancing</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At one time or another, several of the loveshys studied for this book had gotten up enough nerve to try ballroom dance lessons as a possible means to meeting eligible young women. Major commercial dance schools such as Arthur Murray's and Fred Astaire Studios, often run sales promotional schemes which permit a new customer to receive a dozen lessons for under $100. The fact that organizations teaching ballroom dance typically operate parties and socials for their paying students tended to serve as an especially strong lure for the older loveshy men, as did the sort of music which is customarily associated with ballroom dance. Thus, most loveshys very much enjoy "big band" music, as well as the usual fox trots, romantic love ballads, waltzes, tangos, etc., which are usually associated with ballroom dance.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no question about the fact that ballroom dance <i class="calibre4"> could</i> serve as an extremely helpful adjunct to practice-dating therapy. (So indeed could square dancing.) But unfortunately, ballroom dance lessons <i class="calibre4"> which</i> <i class="calibre4">are administered by commercial firms</i> CANNOT BE RECOMMENDED for loveshy men. Here is why:</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, to a loveshy man dancing ability (and some of them already knew how to dance before they took the lessons) <i class="calibre4"> is only a MEANS to an</i> <i class="calibre4">END, and NOT the end itself. </i> To those administering the teaching,  <i class="calibre4"> dancing</i> <i class="calibre4">IS the end in itself. </i> Moreover, many if not most women who are enrolled in dance studio classes are primarily interested in learning dance as an end goal in itself, and NOT as a means to meeting eligible men. This can be observed in what happens when a male student dances with a female student at one of the studio-managed sociables. The female partner will typically focus her entire attention upon doing the dance steps correctly. Virtually <i class="calibre4"> none</i> of her attention will be upon either her male partner or upon the idea of involving herself in a meaningful conversation with him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This sort of scenario is obviously tantamount to placing the cart before the horse as far as loveshy males are concerned. Loveshy males want to meet women (potential mates), and they want to polish up their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p628"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 9 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversational skills. They invariably perceive dancing as only a <i class="calibre4"> means</i> toward this end. And they quite often bitterly resent any intimation that learning how to dance well ought to be the end in itself. They don't mind cooperating by endeavoring to dance satisfactorily. But they both want and demand a program which will accentuate meeting and informally conversing with eligible members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The concept of <i class="calibre4"> "eligible partners" </i> represents another big problem as far as ballroom dance lessons are concerned. Ballroom dance studios quite commonly attract women in their middle and late middle ages. In fact, it is not uncommon to find quite elderly people in attendance at ballroom dance socials. Most of these women are divorced, and virtually all of them are well beyond the childbearing ages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost all loveshy men are interested in finding a woman who is still young enough for going through the pregnancy experience, and who is pretty enough to visually turn them on. Ballroom dance clientele include almost no women who fit this description. And this represents a major disappointment to loveshy, never married men who naively give ballroom dance lessons a try.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, ballroom dance lessons have no effect at all upon ameliorating the loveshyness problem for afflicted men. At best after the lessons are over the loveshy client will simply end up a loveshy man who just happens to know how to dance well. And since he will be too shy to <i class="calibre4"> use</i> or practice these skills, the skills will rapidly fade away as a consequence of disuse.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Social self-confidence and at least a normal ability to deal with interpersonal anxiety <i class="calibre4"> must</i> be gained <i class="calibre4"> first</i> BEFORE the acquiring of such specific technical skills as ballroom dancing ability will do any good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This fact is well illustrated by the following quite poignant comment:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"One time when I was about 26, I noticed an ad for a singles dance in the <i class="calibre4"> New York Times. </i> It was supposed to be held on a Sunday evening at this hotel on the corner of 8th and 34th; and it was supposed to feature romantic band music. I knew how to dance pretty well at that time. And since the ad said the dance was intended only for single men between 21 and 35, and for single women between 18 and 30, my heart started beating kind of hard. Anyway, I thought I should try to gather up enough courage to go to it. Well, I got all dressed up really nicely, and I went. But when I arrived within about a block of the hotel I froze. I mean I really broke out into a cold sweat. I just didn't have the nerve to go in. I remember I walked around and around that hotelâ€”it must have been 25 or 30 times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And each time I walked around it I tried to sneak a glance through the lobby doors to see if I could see anything. I mean I didn't even have the nerve to go into the lobby because I was dressed too well to just make believe I had to phone somebody. Anyway, after I walked around the block about 25 times my mind started drifting to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p629"></a>598 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">less anxiety-provoking subjects. I noticed that the area around the hotel was awfully quiet, even for a Sunday night. So maybe not too many people went to the dance. I mean I didn't see any really attractive girls go in. So after about two hours of just pacing around and around the hotel I just got tired and depressed and went home."</p>
<p class="calibre1">(36-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dancing <i class="calibre4"> may</i> serve as a catalixt to the further development of already existent interpersonal skills and social self-confidence. But these very important psychoemotional attributes obviously need to be present at a certain minimum level before dance lessons can rationally commenceâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless the dance lessons are a concomitant adjunct to a practice-dating therapy program. Simply put, the loveshys studied for this book who knew how to dance were unable to derive any profit therefrom.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Religion</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation with regard to religion is directly analogous to that of ballroom dancing. The goal or <i class="calibre4"> "end" </i> of religious organizations is to disseminate and indoctrinate a religious ideology,  <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> to find lovers and/or marriage partners for loveshy men. Thus we are again faced with a means/end conflict. For the loveshy man, meeting an appropriate single girl represents the all-important "end". And as I made clear in Chapter 20, when he endeavors to use religious organization as a <i class="calibre4"> means</i> to that end, he is highly likely to end up disappointed and frustrated.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Encounter Groups</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite a few of the loveshys studied for this book had tried participating in encounter groups. For a good many years encounter groups had been very popular on the west coast. Thus, it is not surprising that most of the loveshys who had experimented with encounter group participation were California residents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An encounter group is very similar to group psychotherapy. A major difference, of course, is that the facilitator is seldom a professionally trained person. He or she is usually a layperson with a special knack for handling and motivating people. Another difference is that encounter group participants are usually required to sit on the floor or on pillows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordinary chairs are seldom used by most encounter group organizations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The basic goal of encounter groups is to encourage participants to share their feelings and experiences. No one is forced into talking, and no one is prodded into sharing any information about themselves. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p630"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 9 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmosphere is largely permissive. And each session lasts between 90</p>
<p class="calibre1">and 120 minutes. The cost seldom exceeds $5 per person per session.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As with ballroom dancing, a good many of the loveshys interviewed for this book had approached their initial encounter group experiences with an attitude of considerable optimism. And as with ballroom dancing this optimism was shattered. Attractive, single, never married women in the 18-25 age range are almost never found at encounter groups. And the majority of encounter groups have the problem of an extremely poorly balanced sex ratio. A typical scenario might entail 20</p>
<p class="calibre1">people in attendance, including 16 males and only 4 females; the 4</p>
<p class="calibre1">females will <i class="calibre4"> all</i> be in the divorced, 35 to 55 year old age category. In fact, several of the loveshys had found no females at all present at some of the encounter group meetings they had attended.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, encounter group facilitators commonly champion other alleged rewards such as the chance to get away from one's lonely apartment for an evening, the chance to make same-sexed friends, the chance to learn how to open up and share feelings, the chance to observe that one's own problems are not unique, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> The problem, however, is that loveshy males are seldom psychoemotionally capable of <i class="calibre4"> accepting</i> even a <i class="calibre4"> willing</i> male friend unless and until some progress has been made towards meaningful heterosexual interaction. Further, most loveshy men emerge from their encounter group experiences with the distinct impression that their problems <i class="calibre4"> are indeed</i> more unusual and more severe than those of <i class="calibre4"> anybody</i> whom they might have encountered.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, most loveshy men seem to find sitting on the floor for 90 minutes to be exceedingly uncomfortable and often physically painful as well. The ostensible purpose of not having chairs is to facilitate sociable relaxation and the lowering of defenses. For most loveshy men the absence of chairs seems to create the very opposite effect; it makes them even more tense and less relaxed than they usually are. The data which I obtained from the loveshys indicated that 73 percent of them objected to sitting on the floor. In contrast, just 27 percent of the <i class="calibre4"> non-shy</i> male population appears to dislike sitting on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshy men with encounter group experience claimed that sitting on the floor provoked (usually after about twenty minutes) leg cramps, arm discomforts, and aches in the hands. Getting comfortable on the floor with only a soft pillow upon which to sit is evidently something which a significant fraction of the population is ill equipped to do. Hypochondriasis was another problem which evidenced itself among a good many of the loveshys with whom I talked. Thus, several of these men confessed that they found it disconcerting and emotionally uncomfortable to touch any surface (such as a floor or carpet) upon which people walk. These men felt that floors are dirty and unsanitary;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p631"></a>6 0 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">and as a result several of them while in attendance at an encounter group had tried to sit for as long as they could without permitting their hands to touch the rug. Quite understandably, this behavior created aches and other discomforts in the torso and throughout the legs. And the fact that many of these men could hardly wait to get to a sink where they could wash their hands, further served to make concentration upon the encounter group proceedings quite difficult for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the loveshy men did not return twice to the same encounter group organization. Several of them went to as many as four or five different encounter group organizations, each time hoping and expecting to find young, attactive women,  <i class="calibre4"> and chairs</i> upon which to sit. However, each time they were disappointed on both counts. Being too shy to simply leave, they reluctantly paid the required $5, and remained throughout the physically uncomfortable ordeal of a 90-minute session.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, most of the loveshys studied for this book had tried a number of indirect ways of meeting women. Ballroom dance instruction, church groups, encounter groups, attendance at various advertised lectures, etc., had all been tried by the loveshy as a <i class="calibre4"> means</i> to the <i class="calibre4"> end goal</i> of meeting eligible women. Interestingly (and quite significantly), some of the loveshys even attributed their choice of a major field of study at the university to their need to be around young women. One young man had started out majoring in accounting, and had performed satisfactorily in all of his business courses. But he found it necessary to switch to psychology "because I was too depressed about the fact that there were practically no girls in any of my classes." Another man with whom I spoke had switched from electrical engineering (in which he had been averaging <i class="calibre4"> "B" </i> grades) to English literature. And now at age 37 he sorely regrets having made the switch. His <i class="calibre4"> only</i> reason for changing fields was that he had deeply wanted to increase his chances of meeting attractive girls. Yet the taking of a lot of course work in the company of female students failed to help him in this regardâ€”as it had indeed failed to benefit all 300 of the loveshy men studied for this book. Simply put, sitting adjacent to women in a lot of university classes cannot be of any help to a loveshy man until and unless he develops the capacity to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"open up" and relate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each organization has its basic, major manifest purpose. The key purpose of a university is to foster and encourage academic (intellectual) learning. The purpose of a ballroom dance studio is to teach ballroom dancing, and to make lots of money for the owner-managers. The purpose of religious organizations is to disseminate and indoctrinate religious ideologies, etc., etc., <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Thus, every organization has its purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And whereas people occasionally do meet their lifemates while participating in such organizational activities, the accomplishment of such a purpose requires a degree of social finesse and social self-confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p632"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  6 0 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">which the loveshy sorely lack. This is why the loveshy absolutely require active participation and involvement on a daily basis in an organization whose <i class="calibre4"> exclusive</i> purpose is the facilitation of heterosexual interaction among those sincerely desirous of emotionally intimate, meaningful boy/girl type companionship. And in regard to this, practice-dating therapy quite clearly fills the bill far better than anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Might Fraternity Membership Help? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Some people have suggested that university loveshy men ought to be benevolently goaded into signing up with a fraternity. The theory here is that fraternities are socializing agents. They operate to train their members in interpersonal skills; and they inspire the development of lifelong friendships. Fraternities are often viewed as social support systems which do much to involve their members in comfortable, casual and friendly interaction with members of the opposite sex. This is particularly so inasmuch as most fraternities are directly associated with one or more sorority groups with which they exchange frequent parties and informal get-togethers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have no doubt that fraternities and sororities entail an enormous <i class="calibre4">potential</i> for remedying the plight of the loveshy. But as of right now, <i class="calibre4">potential</i> is all that Greek organizations can offer. Fraternities and sororities do engage in a great many charitable activities. But they are <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">in and of themselves charitable organizations. In fact, more than anything else, they are <i class="calibre4"> status placement</i> organizations. And individuals who do not "measure up" are simply not pledged or accorded continued membership.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fraternities <i class="calibre4"> do</i> provide some valuable socialization for interpersonal skills and social self-confidence. However, the problem for the loveshy is that a young man must have <i class="calibre4"> already</i> attained a certain <i class="calibre4"> minimum level</i> of interpersonal skills <i class="calibre4"> BEFORE</i> any fraternity will pledge him. To be sure, loveshys are often outstanding students. But from the standpoint of interpersonal skills they embark upon their college and university educations <i class="calibre4"> seriously retarded. </i> And no fraternity will accept a young man who is conspicuously retarded from the standpoint of social self-confidence and interpersonal skills. And this is true no matter how good a student he might be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A further problem is that the loveshy would have to be (literally) <i class="calibre4">taken by the hand into</i> a fraternity house. Simply put, loveshys simply do not have the nerve to enter and ask about how to pledge. Of course, most students lack a well-structured social support system when they first enter a college or university. But entering college with a satisfactory level of interpersonal self-confidence picked up in high school and earlier,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p633"></a>6 0 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">most freshmen take little time in establishing new networks of meaningful friendships. The loveshy cannot do this. They remain social isolates just as they had been in high school. And as long as there is no one around to take a personal interest in their well-being and to involve them directly in social activities, the loveshy can be fully expected to remain far too inhibited to assert themselves socially and to solicit the opportunity to pledge a fraternity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, an equally difficult problem is the sort of personality which characteristically chooses to become involved with fraternities and sororities. Generally speaking, Greek organizations both attract and pledge the most highly competitive, social status striving young people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most such young people are highly outgoing with very few introspective tendencies. Most are already (as entering freshmen) well above average in social self-confidence; and most are very strict and authoritarian when it comes to insisting upon conformity among fellow members. They are psychologically capable of giving as well as taking hazing and other forms of bullying, and of enjoying the process of such oppressive activities. Like the typical fundamentalistic religious group, fraternity and sorority people are fully amenable to what psychologists call <i class="calibre4"> "groupthink". </i> (See chapter twenty.) Virtually all loveshys are highly individualistic; and as such they are highly averse to anything which smacks of <i class="calibre4"> "groupthink". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, whereas fraternity and sorority students love to associate with the opposite sex, most of them enjoy associating with their own gender a good deal more. And the general thrust of their norms is to discourage strong, romantic pair-bonding prior to the senior year of college. Inasmuch as the loveshy crave strong pair-bonding from the earliest years of elementary school onward, the general attitude towards love and romance prevalent among Greek organization leaders would be highly refractory to the needs of loveshy men. And indeed so would the chauvinistic norm which stipulates that love interests must only be formed with members of Greek organizations, and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> with non-affiliated</p>
<p class="calibre1">"outsiders".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the general attitude towards life which currently prevails in virtually all college and university fraternities is drastically "out of sync" with what loveshy men are emotionally capable of tolerating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Continued membership in a fraternity absolutely requires the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) A willingness to interrupt one's studies at any hour of the day or night, in order to partake in singing or some other raucious, all-male activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) A willingness to participate in a variety of self-degradation activities, particularly during the so-called "pledge period".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p634"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  6 0 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many fraternities still permit hazing; and each year there are at least a half-dozen deaths caused by this and related forms of hypermasculine bullying. Even in places where hazing is not permitted, milder forms of hazing (which may <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be "mild"</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the loveshy) continue to be ubiquotous throughout the world of Greek organizations. In addition, no loveshy man would ever want to haze or bully others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) Fraternity membership absolutely requires the psychoemotional predisposition to enter into the flow of <i class="calibre4"> "groupthink". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, any form of <i class="calibre4"> "groupthink" </i> tends to make loveshy men extremely nervous and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(4) Even though most loveshys drink, they drink only in moderation. Loveshy men reject the idea of drinking for the sake of drinking, or for purposes of proving their masculinity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Refusal to "conform" in this regard would soon result in the ejection of any loveshy person from the midst of any group of fraternity men. It would further result in the public doubting of the loveshy man's masculinity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(5) Loveshy men tend to prefer peace and quiet. They desperately want female companionship and premarital erotic sexuality. But they want even these amenities to be available to them under peaceful and quiet, loving and monogamous circumstances. Even the loveshys' musical tastes tend to be at dramatic variance with those which are <i class="calibre4"> prescribed and enforced</i> upon fraternity men. Loveshy men hate "rock" as well as the kinds of traditional, highly repetitive beer-drinking songs that are sung in unison by fraternity men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(6) Fraternity men are expected to like sports, and to be ready to participate in "rough and tumble" activities at any time of the day or night.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(7) Most loveshy men are far from being at their best vis-a-vis authoritarian leadership. Loveshys have a stronger than average need to make their own day-to-day decisions. They are <i class="calibre4">not</i> "team players". As serious-minded individuals, they are ready to willingly cooperate with others <i class="calibre4"> only when</i> it appears <i class="calibre4">rational</i> to do so. Most of what goes on in a fraternity or sorority house is far from "rational".</p>
<p class="calibre1">(8) Fraternity membership requires a natural ability to find great pleasure in all-male interaction. The loveshy flourish best in situations which are pervasively coeducational through and throughâ€”with preferably more females than males about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(9) Fraternity membership requires an ability to accept a socially and politically conservative ideology. Most loveshys are liberal in their social and political beliefs.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p635"></a>6 0 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">(10) Most loveshy men sustain a negative attitude towards tradition. Tradition and related rituals are very important to Greek organizations. As serious-minded individuals, the loveshy are inclined to look first towards empirical science to decide what is right for them. If a tradition seems tangental or refractory to their personal needs and interests, the loveshy will behave very indifferently towards it. Simply put, loveshy men do not perceive any of the traditions which they encounter as being in consonance with their vested interests. (Traditions had never done anything from the standpoint of correcting their loveshyness problems.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Use of Sorority Girls</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On large university campuses which contain a copious abundance of so-called Greek organizations, the help of sorority girls could be enlisted in dealing with severely loveshy males. Sorority organizations pride themselves upon motivating their girls to take an active role in the provision of charitable services to their local communities. What more worthwhile charity can there be but to help their own male age-mates who have not yet even begun to live their adult lives!  <i class="calibre4"> Charity begins at</i> <i class="calibre4">home, </i> as the old cliche tells us. It would seem to me that to the extent that sorority girls help the socially deprived males on their own university campuses, to that extent they would truly be practicing "charity at home".</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard I asked each of my respondents to answer the following question:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Which of the following two types of social service activities do you view as being the more socially desirable and useful for a group of college sorority girls to engage in?</p>
<p class="calibre1">â€”Spend a couple of hours each week providing companionship in a home for the elderly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">â€”Spend a couple of hours each week helping severely shy college men of their own age get started dating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully 84 percent of the older loveshy men together with 72 percent of the university loveshys checked the <i class="calibre4"> second</i> alternative. In fact, I found it quite gratifying to learn that 55 percent of even the self-confident non-shys would rather see the sorority girls help loveshy males commence dating than see them simply provide companionship in a home for the aging.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, I am not arguing here that the elderly are not also entitled to help, caring and concern. In truth,  <i class="calibre4"> all</i> human beings are. And</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p636"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  6 0 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all human groups it is clear that <i class="calibre4"> very few</i> have heretofore been more severely neglected than that of severely loveshy university males. Studies on the elderly have shown that most old people (1) want to be able to do things for themselves, (2) do <i class="calibre4"> not</i> want anyone around who is going to be feeling sorry for them, and (3) benefit best from being given a pet dog or cat. Many aging people have enjoyed visitations by sorority girls; but many more have been found to view the girls' attitudes as being patronizing and condescending.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, the best group of people to spend blocks of time around the elderly are <i class="calibre4"> very young children</i> in the <i class="calibre4"> age 3 to age 7 group</i>â€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly not college girls. Next to that the elderly appear to benefit enormously from being permitted to keep pet dogs. Visitations to nursing homes have long been among the most frequent charitable activities engaged in by sorority girls. I strongly recommend that this custom be changed forthwith!</p>
<p class="calibre1">For numerous reasons sorority girls could prove to be a tremendously potent source of and impetus for constructive growth and change among loveshy males. Further, some of the girls might find that in spite of themselves they actually grow to <i class="calibre4"> like</i> the loveshy malesâ€”that "still waters run very deep", and that there is far more to the loveshy than meets the eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Several university researchers have found sorority women to be at least somewhat more physically attractive than non-sorority women. In addition, sorority women tend to be above average for their age group in interpersonal skills and finesse. With such personality assets at their command, the services of sorority girls could do much to increase the social self-confidence of loveshy males. For example, each sorority girl could agree to spend one evening per fortnight with a loveshy male.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If that were deemed too much, then one evening per month might well prove extremely helpful if a large number of girls assumed an active role in the program. Loveshy males interested in taking part could simply leave their names, addresses and telephone numbers in some central office, such as the university counseling clinic. And each participating girl would simply draw one name card per each two or four-week period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contests could be developed out of this. Sorority girls, like fraternity men, are known to be well above average in competitive drive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite socially constructive use could be made of their competitive spirit and drive by offering prizes to those women who successfully integrate the largest number of loveshy men into the mainstream of college social life. In other words, those women who do the most to free the intractable inhibitions of the greatest number of loveshy men (thus permitting these men for the first time in their lives to commence dating women of their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p637"></a>6 0 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">choosing), would be awarded such items as $200 prizes, clothing, metals of various sorts, write-ups in the university newspaper, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, some of this prize money could come from a fund established by the loveshy men themselves. Each participating loveshy man might be required to contribute $25 to the prize and award fund. In an effort to sustain a high level of excitement and enthusiasm, at least a dozen girls could be awarded prizes at the end of each five-week period of the 30-week academic year.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">What Can Be Done:</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though membership in conventional fraternities appears to be "out" as an option for loveshy men, it may be feasible to initiate the development of fraternities and sororities just for the shy. Simply put, if the proper organizations existed, students commencing higher education retarded from an interpersonal skills/social self-confidence standpoint would have someplace to go. And they would have an appropriate environment in which to live. They would have a support group at the very outset of their educational experience that would undertake to socialize them for reasonable competence and effectiveness in the social world.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A System of Coed Roommates</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, the world may not be quite ready for it yet. However, what I expect to see happen within the next two or three centuries is that loveshy students of both genders will be assigned opposite sexed roommates immediately upon entrance into a college or university. The best and most sensible preparation for competent and effective interaction in a coeducational world is coeducational livingâ€”with <i class="calibre4"> everything</i> that this might entail. There is no better way to extinguish a person's anxieties pertinent to the other gender than to place him or her in the same bedroom with a roommate of that other genderâ€”in a situation wherein everyone else is <i class="calibre4"> also</i> placed in a bedroom with a roommate of the other gender. Simply put, this is one way to speed the time when loveshy individuals can commence viewing the opposite sex as feeling human beings like themselves, and not as some mysterious entity to fear and to avoid. It is a way to speed the time when all young people of both sexes can truly feel free to "let down their hair" and bare their innermost secrets just as easily in the company of members of the opposite sex as they might be able to do in the company of members of their own sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a particular young man or woman could not get along with his or her roommate, that roommate could be changed. This is what happens</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Courtship System Versus Marriage and the Family</i> Many Americans continue to view premarital cohabitation as competitive with marriage and family life. Today it is becoming increasingly clear to the social scientists who study it that cohabitation is competitive with marriage and the family <i class="calibre4"> if and only if</i> it continues to be practiced by a couple <i class="calibre4"> after</i> the onset of parenthood. Down through the history of man the key purpose of legal marriage has always been (1) to legitimate parenthood, and (2) to assure a stable, orderly and predictable environment for the socialization and propitious growth and development of new offspring. In order to survive with any degree of success, every society must be concerned about the favorable socialization, growth and development of its new generation of offspring. And this is the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> reason why all societies the world over invented systems of marriage and the family.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Courtship</i> is a <i class="calibre4"> screening device</i> for marriage and family relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Courtship represents a system of norms which <i class="calibre4"> precedes</i> marriage. And since courtship precedes marriage, it can never reasonably be construed as being competitive with it. Indeed, rather than being competitive with marriage and family life, a good system of courtship is fully supportive of the highest quality of marriage and family life, and should lead to same in the majority of instances. In short, premarital cohabitation is a <i class="calibre4">courtship custom</i> and is <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> in any way competitive with marriage and family institutions. Premarital cohabitation and premarital sexmaking must never be interpreted as being "alternatives" to marriage. Like any attribute of the courtship system, premarital cohabitation should be construed as being part of the preparation and screening for the eventual development of happy, fulfilling, lifelong marriages, and for the development of happy adulthood lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless a young person is very lucky and happens to meet very early in life with a person who is virtually ideal for him/her, I believe that young people should have the experience of cohabiting one at a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p639"></a>6 0 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">time with several different opposite sexed roommates before they finally decide upon a permanent one for the marriage and family phases of their lives. Indeed, there are probably few if any groups for whom the experience of premarital cohabitation would be more thoroughly beneficial than that of the loveshyâ€”of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> genders.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Use of Autistic Adolescent Girls</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the especially interesting (if somewhat bizarre) characteristics of autistic children is that they tend to be unusually beautiful/</p>
<p class="calibre1">handsome. Indeed, most autistic people tend to be quite far above average on looks. Moreover, they are quite probably the <i class="calibre4"> only</i> beautiful people lacking in a strong aura. Virtually all beautiful girls/women tend to be highly sociable, status striving and dominant. Simply put, their general ambiance and demeanor tends to be perceived by loveshy men as highly threatening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet as this book has shown, loveshy males seem to have an unusually strong and uncompromising need for a girl with beautyâ€”with long hair, pretty, youthful face, and trim figure. Loveshys also seem to be turned on by women who are beautiful enough not to wear any make-upâ€”whose beauty is natural and not in any way artificial.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems to me that the foregoing facts suggest the desirability of therapeutic experimentation with autistic teenaged and young adult girls.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Theodore Issac Rubin's charming story of DAVID AND LISA clearly illustrated how an inhibited, highly neurotic high school boy could be greatly healed of his problems as a result of his love relationship with a beautiful, autistic girl. And, of course, the same true story also documented how the autistic girl was also able to substantially improve as a result of her love relationship with the inhibited, neurotic boy.  <i class="calibre4"> Love</i> is inherently therapeutic, and is the "universal solvent" for all psychoemotional problems, including ones like loveshyness that are rooted in <i class="calibre4">genetic</i> attributes which (in males) are not appreciated in our highly competitive, aggressive world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, the typical beautiful girl here in America does not act as though she needs any protection or nurturance. Similarly, the typical beautiful girl does not act as though she has any interest at all in being nurturant towards any young man, or in being impressed by his intellectual or educational accomplishments. If some experiments were done in which severely loveshy males were introduced to beautiful autistic girls (e.g., in university psychotherapy centers), a very great deal of good might be accomplished for everyone involved. To be sure, the loveshy man and the autistic girl would have to be assigned to a series</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p640"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  6 0 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">of activities that would require them to work together on some task on a day-after-day basis. And on a semi-supervised basis they would need to be given a good deal of time alone together. For example, each couple could be assigned to take care of one or two pet dogs; these might serve as a catalyst for facilitating rapid, therapeutic interaction. However such an experiment might be managed, I think it would yield some particularly fascinating and immediately usable data.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Changing the Norms</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most obvious ways of preventing the development of severe loveshyness is simply that of changing certain social norms. After all, if loveshyness is indeed primarily due to a poorness of fit between social expectations and inborn temperament, then it stands to reason that loveshyness will rapidly diminish to the extent that the norms are restructured to be in greater harmony with man's nature.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The major norm in need of changing is the one which stipulates that the male,  <i class="calibre4"> not the female, </i> must <i class="calibre4"> always</i> be the one to make the first move in initiating cross-sexed friendships and conversations. I would suggest that NATIVE TEMPERAMENT and <i class="calibre4"> NOT gender</i> should be the prime determinant in any given situation as to which sex should make the first move towards the initiation of a friendship. There is no evidence that the native temperaments of males and females differ substantially regarding the natural proclivity to be assertive. Women who are naturally assertive should be both permitted and encouraged to make the first move. And corollatively, men who are naturally passive should be both allowed and encouraged to play the passive roleâ€”without any cost to them in social respect, honor or esteem. No one should be penalized for attributes that accrue from native temperament.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly, we must stop socializing (hypnotizing) our little girls into believing that they should never ask boys for dates. Elementary school children at all levels from kindergarten through the eighth grade should be exposed to learning experiences which make it very clear that gender should never have anything whatsoever to do with the issue of who should assume the socially assertive role in any given cross-sexed situation. Parents need to be helped towards an understanding as to why the traditional norm prescribing social assertiveness for males but proscribing it for females is destructive and highly deleterious to mental health and self-actualization. They should be helped to understand why this norm needs to be thrown away forever into the trash can and replaced with a normative system that is compassionate and congruent with the needs and natures of human beings. Inasmuch as the family</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p641"></a>6 1 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the prime socializer of all children, it is quite clear that adults must be won over as to the belief and conviction that certain traditional norms promote loveshyness, loneliness, and poor mental health. Lectures and discussions at PTA meetings might well be a good place at which to commence this effort.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "Sadie Hawkins" Type Event</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, and several other German cities, there are some very popular establishments at which the women <i class="calibre4">(only the women)</i> ask the men for dancesâ€”and if a man refuses a given woman he is asked to leave.3 Similarly in America the "Sadie Hawkins"</p>
<p class="calibre1">dance is a social event to which the girls are expected to ask the boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If a program of social change is ultimately to prove successful in reducing the incidence of loveshyness, I believe that it must make copious use of so-called "Sadie Hawkins" type events. And these should commence from a very early point onward in the lives of our children. Certainly by the time of junior and senior high school, fully <i class="calibre4"> fifty percent</i> of all cross-sexed social events should be designated as being of "the girl asks the boy" variety. Over time I believe that this approach might effectively teach young people that whichever gender group a person belongs to has no bearing at all upon who should make the first move in informal social situations. In this way our sexist social norms <i class="calibre4"> can</i> in time be made to undergo sweeping reform.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One way of assuring full participation at all cross-sexed social events (by those who truly wish to participate) is to make up a list of all persons in a school who indicate on a questionnaire that they would like to attend a specific event with an opposite sexed partner. A few weeks before the social event, this list would be posted in some central location, such as on a bulletin board just outside the principal's office. Each time a girl asks a boy (or a boy asks a girl) to the event, the name of both students would be crossed off the list. On the final Friday before the social event, all remaining names on the list would be placed into a hat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the principal or school counselor would pair up each of the remaining names so that everyone who wished to attend the event with an opposite sexed partner would be able to do so. Again, students not wishing to attend the event would not have their names on the list in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. In chapters 2 and 3 I explained how each of us is born with a set of <i class="calibre4"> elastic</i> limits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since these limits are elastic, people <i class="calibre4"> can</i> work towards forms of personal change that are in consonance with their goals. However, just as every elastic band has its own "breaking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p642"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention 611</p>
<p class="calibre1">point",  <i class="calibre4"> people</i> similarly have different "breaking points". This represents a key reason why it is counterproductive as well as highly uncompassionate to require all males to face either military or any other type of situation entailing or necessitating physical aggression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. During the past several years numerous experiments have been conducted in this regard. In a representative study conducted in London (see Fogle, 1984), a large sample of men and women were asked to take a two-mile walk along a particular route.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After each man or woman completed the walk by himself/herself, he/she was asked to take the same walkâ€”only this time with his/her dog. Each experimental subject was closely followed and observed from behind by a professionally trained scientist. And note was systematically taken of all interactions, eye contacts, etc., vis-a-vis strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, whereas the experimental subjects averaged <i class="calibre4"> zero</i> conversations with strangers when they took the two-mile walk by themselves, these same men and women averaged <i class="calibre4">three</i> conversations when they took the same walk with their dog. It should be noted that the men as well as the women ended up talking to significantly more people when they walked with their dogs than when they walked alone. And whereas unusually beautiful and ornate breeds tended to attract the most attention,  <i class="calibre4"> any dog</i> was found to constitute a powerful catalyst for facilitating <i class="calibre4"> human</i> interaction. Indeed, even those male adults walking mongrels averaged more conversations than those walking alone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. So far as I am aware, there has never been an establishment anywhere where a <i class="calibre4">woman</i> is asked to leave if she refuses a man's request for a dance. Herein lies testimony as to the second class status of the male sex throughout the western world.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. For the best research heretofore published on the bullying-whipping boy phenomenon the reader is referred to the work of Dan Olweus which is cited in the bibliography. See especially his 1984 paper.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p643"></a>
<a id="p644"></a>Chapter 25</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Some Final Thoughts</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In psychological circles whenever recommendations are made regarding the practical issue of how to help a shy person, the focus has almost always been upon how to motivate that person to help himself/</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself. Almost never does a psychiatrist or psychologist endeavor to even think about engineering ways of trouble-shooting the problem for the shyness victim. Thus, psychology and psychiatry are both very much unlike conventional medicine wherein the practice has always been to engineer viable ways of permanently curing the patient's presenting problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A major thesis of this book is that conventional psychological and psychiatric approaches cannot and will not work for cases of prolonged and intractable loveshyness. Indeed, for most cases of loveshyness I believe that all the usual psychotherapeutic approaches are fundamentally wrong, inappropriate, misleading, and counterproductive. I believe that this is so for three key reasons:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) As this book has clearly documented, severe loveshyness is rooted in a range of <i class="calibre4"> genetic</i> and <i class="calibre4"> congenital</i> factors over which the victim never had any control or responsibility. Being born with a strongly dominant <i class="calibre4"> inhibition gene</i> constitutes a key basis for the development of intractable loveshyness <i class="calibre4"> in males. </i> As such, shyness is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> a "psychological problem" in the first instance unless and until society (especially peer group and family) defines it as one, reacts to it as one, and makes it one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) All the available evidence quite clearly demonstrates that loveshy men absolutely require very strong catalysts. Left to their own devices they will do nothing to help themselves. A loveshy man could dine every night for a year in a university dining hall composed of 70 percent young women and only 30 percent young men. Yet unless someone actually took a personal interest in that loveshy man and consistently saw to it <i class="calibre4"> on a day after</i> <i class="calibre4">day basis</i> that he ate with and interacted with women, he would be just as badly off (most probably <i class="calibre4"> worse</i> off) at the end of the 6 1 3</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p645"></a>6 1 4 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">year as he had been at the beginning of it. To be sure, none of the young women would take it upon themselves to assert themselves in a friendly manner vis-a-vis such a loveshy, conspicuously isolated young man. In essence, victims of intractable loveshyness <i class="calibre4"> cannot and must not</i> be expected to "help themselves out", to "solve their own problems", to "grab the bull by the horns" (when the bull hasn't got any horns), <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> I believe that society has an ethical responsibility to find and get loveshy men situated with appropriately suitable female love-partners.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) Conventional psychotherapeutic approaches <i class="calibre4"> waste time. </i> And time is an extremely valuable resource when it comes to helping severely loveshy people. As loveshy men become increasingly older they become <i class="calibre4"> decreasingly</i> confident vis-a-vis attractive, eligible young women. It becomes increasingly difficult for loveshy men as to an increasing extent they inevitably grow too old for women who have never given birth to a child. Time is of the essence in treating loveshyness. As more and more time passes in the absence of <i class="calibre4"> appropriate</i> treatment, the problem becomes more and more overwhelming in its level of difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For a loveshy man there is no catalyst more powerfully therapeutic than a copious abundance each and every day of informal heterosexual interaction among genuinely eligible young women. Such heterosexual interaction must be guaranteed and assured all severely loveshy men.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, conservative minds decry the idea of providing loveshy males with a "crutch". In psychotherapy "crutches" are commonly thought to foster dependency. Yet in medicine crutches are known to speed the day when a person can function on his or her own unencum-bered. Crutches also permit self-sufficiency, even as the healing is going on.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, if subsequent to a skiing accident the victim were not supplied with suitable and appropriate crutches, he or she would be constrained to remain indoors. He or she would not be able to get around and to pursue a normal life. And what is perhaps of even greater importance, he or she would require <i class="calibre4"> much more time</i> to recuperate from the skiing injury. In short, crutches not only permit a person to lead some semblance of a normal life while they are recovering; but crutches also facilitate a maximally speedy and propitious recovery.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have stressed throughout this book, dependency is a prerequisite for socialization and for growth.  <i class="calibre4"> Therapeutic crutches</i> in psychotherapy as well as in medicine permit the person to venture forth and to develop his/her incapacitated muscles. A crutch permits a person with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p646"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 1 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">a broken leg to develop and strengthen his/her incapacitated muscles by using them in as near-normal a manner as possible. The <i class="calibre4"> "therapeutic</i> <i class="calibre4">crutch" </i> that is intrinsic in practice-dating therapy, in matchmaking services, in "Shys Anonymous", in "Coed Scouting", etc., similarly permits the person incapacitated by severe loveshyness to exercise what limited interpersonal skills he might have, and to thereby slowly but surely develop increasingly strong social self-confidence. Without the "crutch"</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loveshy person cannot "go out" at all. What few positive attributes he might have are thereby condemned to wither and undergo severe atrophy through disuseâ€”just as a leg muscle would undergo severe atrophy if the accident victim failed to receive a "crutch" which would <i class="calibre4">permit</i> him to exercise that muscle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as a seriously crippled person would never be expected to go out and prematurely fend for himself, this should not be expected of a loveshy person either. Further, no orthopedic physician in his/her right mind would allow a patient to depend upon a mere set of instructions that would, if followed, permit a full recovery. It is the orthopedic surgeon who first places the cast on the broken leg. The surgeon <i class="calibre4"> never</i> requires his/her patient to do this for himself/herself. A competent physician further takes his/her patient by the hand and gets him started on certain regular exercises. Eventually the patient will do these on his/her own. But at the outset (and sometimes for a long time after the outset) the physician and his/her assistants accompanies the patient and helps him/her through each exercise. And so it is with practice-dating therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, loveshy men are cripples, every bit as much as a person born with a twisted leg is a cripple. In essence, neither the loveshy male nor the person born with a twisted leg managed to enter the world with the properties which American society deems "desirable" and "normal". A dominant inhibition gene gives rise to effects that are every bit as "undesirable" (in terms of public reaction) as does a twisted leg. Close, personalized attention together with good <i class="calibre4"> therapeutic crutches</i> (and the dependency which these entail) will effectively remedy both kinds of problemsâ€”at least to the point of permitting the victims of these problems to lead normal, productive lives. On the other hand, deny a "crutch"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and temporary dependency to <i class="calibre4"> either</i> person and you deny him/her the chance to become a normal, happy, productive citizen.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A Different Philosophy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of the foregoing it is clear that this book reflects a philosophy that is very different from that which prevails in contemporary psychotherapeutic circles. However, it is not my purpose to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">"different" just for the sake of being "different". In order for therapeutic</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p647"></a>616</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommendations to be of any real use they must harmonize with the facts concerning what loveshyness is and how it develops. Up to now none of the books and articles pretending to make recommendations pertinent to therapeutic modalities that might be suitable for loveshyness have any kind of an empirical research basis at all. Simply put, the book which you have just finished reading is the first to provide a fully comprehensive, interdisciplinary, research-based explanation as to what loveshyness is and of how it develops and worsens over time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that the recommendations contained in this book jibe with the facts on loveshyness that are now known. The recommendations contained in other works are based to a greater extent upon wishful thinking than on facts. They are based on the idea that <i class="calibre4"> all</i> human beings can be successfully motivated to "pick themselves up by their own bootstraps" on the basis of mere exposure to one or another of the myriad</p>
<p class="calibre1">"talking cures", which is all that the vast majority of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists ever endeavor to offer. As I have demonstrated in this book, a person without "bootstraps" cannot pick himself up by these!</p>
<p class="calibre1">You cannot force square pegs into round holes. Conventional psychotherapeutic approaches are simply inappropriate for loveshy men because each of these is premised upon the assumption that the loveshy client already possesses certain necessary "bootstraps" which all the best available data quite clearly indicate he does <i class="calibre4"> not</i> possess.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, the philosophy of therapy recommended by this book has been criticized for discouraging the development among loveshys of proper adult levels of self-sufficiency. However, throughout this book I have tried to show that meaningful female companionship represents the most powerful catalyst for growth and adult masculine self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as adult male loveshys are concerned, I can think of nothing that holds a stronger potential for promoting growth and psychological health (including self-sufficiency) than meaningful involvement with a suitable female companion and lover.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Furthermore, dependency is a prerequisite for socialization (which is what psychotherapy is) and for full-fledged adult self-sufficiency. Most contemporary psychotherapists approach the concept of dependency and "crutches" with irrational levels of trepidation and lack of understanding.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">What Is Needed</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the loveshy man the central problem of life is that of how to find an opposite sexed confidant and fall in love. A number of anthropologists have suggested that this problem may be much greater for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p648"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 1 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans than for members of certain other cultures in which there is less freedom of choice about social relations. Brain (1976), for example, discussed cultures in which arranged marriages and even arranged same-sexed friendships guarantee that <i class="calibre4"> everyone</i> has those social ties that are considered essential by the culture. He commented:</p>
<p class="calibre1">"We have overrated the necessity of choosing our friends and wives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We decry arranged marriages . . . Choice is the thing! However, this freedom of choice often means that it is never madeâ€”hence the frustrated spinsters, the friendless and the lonely." (Brain, 1976, p. 19)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doubtless the forcing of everyone to accept arranged marriages would never be workable or even desirable. However, for those wishing to accept the idea of having their dates and their ultimate marriages arranged for them, I believe that this option needs to become freely and easily available. It is perfectly possible for a person to go all the way through life without <i class="calibre4"> ever</i> being able to start a conversation with a stranger in a purely social (non-impersonal) situational context and <i class="calibre4"> still</i> be happy and fulfilled. For the large majority of the male population, on the other hand, it is most assuredly NOT possible for a person to go through life without a marriage partner or an intimate confidant, and <i class="calibre4"> still</i> be happy, well adjusted and productive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Except for those who are violent, I believe that <i class="calibre4"> every man</i> should have the right, guaranteed and assured <i class="calibre4"> by law, </i> to be married by the age of 28, and to be actively involved in heterosexual dating and courtship by the age of 18. Again, no one would ever be forced to take advantage of such a law. However, such a law and social policy needs to exist for the protection of the many loveshy men who <i class="calibre4"> do</i> very much want to date and to court and to marry, but who haven't got the requisite nerve to be able to lift a finger for purposes of helping themselves in this regard. We have employment agencies which get people jobs which they could very easily get for themselves if they had the psychoemotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">"gumption". We have travel agencies which make travel arrangements for peopleâ€”arrangements which they could easily make for themselves, often at considerably less cost. And we have dog grooming centers for people who for one reason or another are "too damned lazy" to learn how to groom their own pooch. We even have professional housecle-aners for people who do not want or are not able to clean their own homes or apartments. I would contend that there is similarly no reason at all as to why analogous organizations ought not to become available for tending to the far more important needs of those who want and need heterosexual companionship but are incapable due to loveshyness of obtaining it for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p649"></a>6 1 8 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">One young man told me that he would be willing to pay $20,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">up front to a yenta (Jewish matchmaker) who could guarantee that within one year of the time he affixed his signature to the contract he would be married. His only stipulation was that he would have to have reasonable veto power over the selections made.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This attitude towards yentas and other matchmakers was not unlike that of most of the severely loveshy men who were studied for this book. Loveshys want to avoid having to suffer what they commonly refer to as the "indignity" of going through the regular dating and courtship process. Yet they still very much want to get married and to experience a normal family life. A fear of rejection and of risk-taking may well be an integral component of most loveshyness cases. But why should all people be forced into suffering rejection simply because they want to have a wife and family? As the old cliche stipulates, "one man's meat is another man's poison". Many men actually <i class="calibre4"> enjoy</i> the chase (the <i class="calibre4">process</i> of finding and winning a girl) far more than they enjoy the ultimate victory or conquest. The loveshy are just the opposite of this; and they wish to avoid "the chase" to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a highly competitive society such as the United States, we tend to "put down" such loveshyness-related attitudes. And yet it is not difficult to see how an "anti-chase" type of man might stand a far better chance than most men of being fully faithful to his wifeâ€”if the fates allow him to ever end up getting one! If a man does not enjoy "the chase", he can most probably be counted upon to remain at home nights and weekends with his wife and children. Contrariwise, who is to say that a man who thoroughly enjoyed "the chase"  <i class="calibre4"> before</i> marriage is going to be able to quite suddenly <i class="calibre4"> stop</i> enjoying "the chase" the minute he finds himself married?! In this respect the loveshy may well be more adaptable to the demands and expectations of stable family life than the socially well-skilled charmer of great finesse whom everyone likes and with whom everyone wants to go to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, one of the questions I asked of each of my respondents has an interesting bearing upon this issue. I asked: "Should people try to continue their marriage if one or both of them becomes dissatisfied?"</p>
<p class="calibre1">And 47 percent of the older loveshys together with 38 percent of the younger ones said "yes", compared to only 20 percent of the self-confident, non-shy men. These differences certainly suggest that loveshy people are probably a good deal more likely than the non-shy to exercise patience and tolerance in marriage. At the very least, it would certainly appear that the loveshy would be much more difficult than most people to provoke into divorce.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the standpoint of therapy for the loveshy, I believe that a nationwide network of practice-dating clinics needs to be established.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p650"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 1 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, I believe that a network of professionally staffed marriage-arranging organizations is sorely needed. The kinds of dating services which currently prevail in our cities are of very little help to severely loveshy men. What is needed is a marriage-arranging organization that will stick to the job until "the job" has been properly accomplished for each loveshy client.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In traditional times the "yenta" (Jewish matchmaker) took a deep and abiding <i class="calibre4"> personal interest</i> in each one of her clients. She took it upon herself to quite closely follow up each male and female client until each was appropriately suited and married. Thus, in contrast to the contemporary dating service, the yenta did not follow the model of disinterested big business. She made it her business never to forget a client until he/</p>
<p class="calibre1">she finally married.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems quite likely that most young Americans would not want any yentas "on their backs". However, loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> typical young Americans. And indeed, most severely loveshy men would welcome a deeply dedicated yenta with open arms and with the utmost enthusiasm. Like the Jewish aunt in the small Polish community of a century ago, a good yenta would be expected to work very closely with and very closely follow up upon each one of her clients until each one is suitably married.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the severely loveshy man some extremely important functions are served through a well coordinated institution of arranged marriages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting a wife for oneself without the benefit of a marriage arrangement option requires the ability to function in unstructured social situations where there is no "script" or "role" to play. As we have seen, loveshy males cannot handle such unstructured situational contexts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For most people dating and courtship fulfills a <i class="calibre4"> screening</i> function.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, most young men and women are psychoemotionally capable of screening each other. The loveshy person is not capable of doing this because his native anxiety threshold is too low; he experiences painful anxiety too easily, too frequently, and too strongly compared to most people. In doing the screening for the loveshy man, the yenta would be screening out any woman who might be conspicuously wrong for the loveshy man, or who might be viewed by him as cold and indifferent. Thus, the matchmaker saves the loveshy man the kind of psychoemotional pain and embarrassment of which he is so strongly afraid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At what juncture in time should loveshy men be encouraged to pursue the yenta option? I believe that the loveshy should be strongly encouraged to regularly attend and participate in the activities of a practice-dating clinic. Such clinics should be available to all loveshy males from the age of 15 onward. Those who continue to remain single and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p651"></a>6 2 0</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">unattached beyond their 28th birthday would be encouraged to retain the deeply dedicated services of a professional matchmaker.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In no case would a man or woman ever be required to accept a matchmaker's selection. As commonly prevailed in traditional times, a man or woman could veto the yenta's selection after according that selection the benefit of a few lengthy conversations. The important virtue of having a deeply dedicated matchmaker at one's disposal is that in a very caring, professional way she continues to search out an opposite sexed partner who will prove fully suitable and acceptable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is, of course, a great deal of sham and pretense inherent in the courtship role. In America most young people relish this sham and pretenseâ€”at least for a few years during late adolescence and early adulthood. It is part of the <i class="calibre4"> "game</i> of love". And most young people have been socialized (programmed; hypnotized) in such a way as to relish</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"games" </i> of all types. In contrast, severely loveshy men are highly romantic. And like romantic people generally, they thoroughly dislike and wish to completely avoid this sham and pretense (game aspect) of dating and courtship activity. They don't want to "role play". They want to get right to the heart of things by finding and fully committing themselves to their one lifelong "soulmate"â€”that girl with the long hair, pretty face, trim, youthful figure, and noncompetitive, nurturing personality. In short, many men cannot psychoemotionally deal with the sham and pretense "role playing" that is integral to dating and courtship. Loveshys simply don't like to play games!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, loveshy men are <i class="calibre4"> results oriented</i> rather than <i class="calibre4"> process oriented. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most young people are capable to at least some extent of enjoying the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"process" </i> of screening many opposite sexed partners before committing themselves on a deep, psychoemotional level to just one. In fact, many young people are quite capable of relishing the many embarrassing moments that are an inevitable component of heavy involvement in dating and courtship activity. Because of their low anxiety thresholds, their inhibition genes, and their low social self-confidence, loveshy men are not capable of "laughing off" embarrassing moments. Indeed, embarrassing moments often cause loveshys to emotionally shudder for weeks and sometimes months after the event had taken place. Of course, their lack of male friendships and their situational status as "loners" further serve to make it very difficult for loveshys to forget psychological pains, insults, embarrassing moments, misunderstood signals, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To the extrovert, the <i class="calibre4"> process</i> of doing something (winning a girl, developing a musical talent, a vocational competence, etc.), is usually more important than the end result of finally getting what he/she wants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, to the extrovert the real enjoyment of life rests in the <i class="calibre4"> process</i> with all of its embarrassing moments, failures, setbacks, turbulence and minor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p652"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 2 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">victories which are experienced along the way. To the highly inhibited person, on the other hand, successfully (and rapidly) attaining the desired end result is the only thing that matters. The loveshys' constant need is to attain their goals <i class="calibre4"> without</i> experiencing any embarrassing moments and with the least amount of psychoemotional turbulence (anxiety) possible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key problem here is that those providing psychotherapeutic services often pursue a quite moralistic stance with regard to this issue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They often expect severely loveshy men to become as <i class="calibre4"> "process oriented" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">as the average extrovert. And such "therapists" imply vis-a-vis their loveshy clients that they (the loveshys) are not entitled to a woman unless and until they (the loveshys) become as fully process oriented as the average extrovert.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, this quite prevalent attitude among "psychotherapists"</p>
<p class="calibre1">serves as a strong roadblock to meaningful communication. And it represents a key reason why few loveshy men remain in conventional psychotherapy for very long. Many therapists assume a similar attitude with respect to risk-taking. Their attitude seems to be that unless a loveshy man becomes willing to risk-take, to become a gambler, then he is not entitled to emotionally close female companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, the attitude of such therapists is that the unwillingness to risk-take and the unwillingness to become "process oriented" should receive the therapeutic emphasis,  <i class="calibre4"> not</i> the need to engineer a viable way of getting the client a suitable female lover. Indeed, the loveshys' need for a girlfriend should be all but forgotten in therapy, according to these therapists. Again, this attitude represents a powerful roadblock to meaningful and effective communication. And it all but guarantees that loveshy men will steer themselves very clear of all conventional psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, moralistic attitudes serve as roadblocks to therapeutic communication. There is a kind of <i class="calibre4"> tyranny</i> here too, which should be quite evident to most readers. After all, why shouldn't a shy man be free to choose to concern himself primarily with the <i class="calibre4"> "process" </i> of sustaining a good marriage (or premarital cohabitation relationship) instead of with the sham and pretense (game playing) process of conventional dating and courtship?! To the loveshy man it is far better to get right to the person with whom he is likely to spend the balance of his life. Rather than being "fun", playing the field is very frightening and anxiety provoking to shy men. They dream of having their "fun" exclusively with just one female lover.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the thought seldom crosses the minds of most conventional therapists that female companionship might serve as a powerful catalyst causing the loveshy to begin taking some risks and to begin deriving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p653"></a>6 2 2 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">some enjoyment out of the <i class="calibre4"> "process" </i> of life and of living. Thus, for some people meaningful female companionship may have to <i class="calibre4"> precede</i> an ability to take risks rather than the other way around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Interpersonal Skills versus Interpersonal Anxiety</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past few years a number of researchers have challenged the assumption that loveshy people are deficient in interpersonal skills.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, in some studies the loveshy have been found to be no less <i class="calibre4"> knowledgeable</i> of interpersonal skills than the socially self-confident non-shys. Of course, the key word here is "knowledgeable". The loveshy often <i class="calibre4"> "know" </i> as much as the non-shy. But their inhibition and low interpersonal anxiety thresholds serve to effectively keep them from applying this knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many psychologists perceive such interpersonal anxiety fears as being rooted in a "fear of rejection". And in some important respects such psychologists are correct. However, the problem for severely loveshy people is that anxiety fears (e.g., the fear of an anxiety attack) override rational, intellectual considerations. It is comparatively easy to get many loveshy men to agree that the anxiety fears motivating their social withdrawal tendencies are rooted to a major extent in a fear of rejection. But accepting and/or agreeing with that fact is almost never enough to motivate a change in behavior. It is never enough to cause a severely loveshy man to start a friendly conversation with a girl, and thus risk rejection.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Rationally and intellectually</i> the loveshy man <i class="calibre4"> "knows" </i> that there are plenty of other "fishes in the sea"; and that if he is rejected (even if this is done crudely and callously) the consequences for his ultimate social success need be nothing more than nil. But that fear of a painful anxiety attack ensuing from either (1) the fact of being rejected, or (2) from being lost for words or from not handling a conversation adequately, determines his behavior. In short, it determines that he will abstain from all attempts at trying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most lay people and, indeed, most clinical psychologists have great difficulty understanding the enormous potency of these anxiety fears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And I think the main reason for that fact is that fortunately most people are born with reasonably high anxiety thresholds. As I clearly documented in the first part of this book, people with low native thresholds tend to experience anxiety feelings (1) <i class="calibre4"> sooner</i> than most people do in any given situation which they have learned to associate with anxiety, (2) <i class="calibre4"> more</i> <i class="calibre4">frequently</i> than most peopleâ€”as a result of learning to associate a wider</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p654"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 2 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">variety of different sorts of stimuli and experiences with anxiety feelings, and (3) <i class="calibre4"> more intensely and painfully</i> than most people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The third (#3) factor is doubtless the most important and significant one from the standpoint of arriving at a proper understanding of the behavior and behavioral inaction of the severely and intractably loveshy. It is virtually impossible for a severely loveshy person to communicate to a less shy person how excruciatingly painful an anxiety attack really is. The vast majority of people have never experienced such a thing and doubtless never could experience it. And this is because most people had had the good fortune to have been born with <i class="calibre4"> normally</i> <i class="calibre4">high</i> anxiety thresholds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">During the years I spent interviewing for this book, I was told time and time again that <i class="calibre4"> anxiety is a thing that is more fearsome than death itself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, loveshy men use different words and expressions to convey this view. But always there is a clear message to the effect that severely loveshy people are incapable of handling or constructively coping with anxiety attacks, or with the fear of same. Thus, the severely loveshy will do virtually anything to prevent anxiety feelings from happening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, the loveshy tend to <i class="calibre4"> remember</i> their multitudinous anxiety attacks of the past. Virtually all such past attacks had involved <i class="calibre4"> social</i> <i class="calibre4">situations</i> of one sort or another, thus explaining how the loveshys had learned to associate anxiety feelings with people. And the word <i class="calibre4"> "past" </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">here can mean as much as 40 or more years ago. For example, one 48-year old loveshy man could be hurled into a severe fit of anxiety simply by remembering embarrassing situations that had befallen him during his earliest years of elementary school. Loveshy people seem to have a difficult time forgetting, even when they strongly wish to forget. And events of many years ago can cause them very painful anxiety spells.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, such spells are doubtless exacerbated by the absence of anyone in the loveshys' lives to distract them. Presumably if someone were around, loveshy people would not have to deal with quite so many foul memories entering into their conscious minds on an uninvited basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, many loveshys seem to worry that their private reactions to anxiety (i.e., how they react to anxiety when they are in private) may become uncontrollably manifest in public places, and thus compound the intensely severe and prolonged painfulness of the anxiety itself. For example, when in private many loveshys fly off into a spate of uncontrolled neoglogisms (the uttering of words that are not words in any known language). A great many of them run outside even during the dark, early hours of the morningâ€”if the early morning happens to be the occasion for an anxiety attack. Still others display a spate of spastic-like facial, hand and arm movements whenever they experience</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p655"></a>6 2 4 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">painful anxiety feelings while alone. Thus, many loveshys fear such loss of control while in public.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some Final Thoughts on Prevention</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout this book I have underscored the importance of preventive efforts with respect to loveshyness. Whereas it is true that the underlying basis for loveshyness is <i class="calibre4"> inborn, </i> the problem itself is learned as I clearly documented in chapters two and three. Because society reacts in very nasty ways to little boys who persistently display behaviors brought about by the inhibition and low anxiety threshold genes, painful</p>
<p class="calibre1">"people-phobias" tend to develop. And when such boys are required to grow up in families which do not contain sisters, severe and intractable loveshyness is highly likely to develop. This is especially true when (1) the parents are incompetent from the standpoint of adequately managing, understanding and accepting a highly inhibited boy, and (2) when the parents are comparatively isolated from any kind of meaningful, extended kin network including uncles, aunts, cousins, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With respect to the first point, it is widely accepted today in psychological circles that a child is free to change only to the extent that he/she is accepted and respected <i class="calibre4"> as he/she is</i>â€”highly inhibited or otherwise. As the data presented in this book quite clearly demonstrated, the loveshys' parents had always sustained a deep and abiding preoccupation with their children's weaknesses, shortcomings, inadequacies, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Yet it is well-known in psychological research circles today that <i class="calibre4">focusing on weaknesses serves to block communication and meaningful growth;</i> and that concentrating on strengths vis-a-vis a child tends to open up meaningful communication, encourage participation and positive change.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, concentrating upon weaknesses tends to <i class="calibre4"> strengthen and enhance</i> those very weaknesses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In this regard it is worth repeating Alexander Thomas' key conclusion inasmuch as it has a strong bearing upon how severe shyness develops: <i class="calibre4"> Behavior disorders</i> (including intractable shyness) <i class="calibre4"> are caused by</i> <i class="calibre4">a bad fit between a child's inborn temperament on the one hand, and parental,</i> <i class="calibre4">teacher and peer expectations on the other. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As Thomas and others have been able to demonstrate, being born high on introversion (inhibition) <i class="calibre4"> and</i> high on emotionality is NEVER</p>
<p class="calibre1">ENOUGH by itself to create a "people-phobia". Thus, when an introvert with a low anxiety threshold is accorded (1) a plentiful abundance of pleasurable play experiences with peers, and (2) genuine acceptance <i class="calibre4"> (as</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p656"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 2 5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">he is)</i> from his parents, he invariably develops a healthy sociability and social self-confidence. As an introvert he will ordinarily prefer just a few very close friends in lieu of many less close ones; and he will usually prefer play and recreation that is more or less on the quiet side.  <i class="calibre4"> But he</i> <i class="calibre4">will</i> (and this is the important point) <i class="calibre4"> be normally sociable; </i> he will be able to genuinely enjoy the companionship of others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, my position is that people entering the world with high inhibition and low anxiety thresholds are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> entering the world "sick".</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe they are made "sick" by a sick society. And it is high time that we started to think seriously about ways of constructively changing this sick society instead of trying all the time to force the individual with difficulties to do all the changing. A person with high inhibition and a low anxiety threshold can, under propitious circumstances, become fully healthy from a psychoemotional standpoint. Females with this combination of genetic characteristics <i class="calibre4"> usually</i> develop reasonably healthy levels of self-esteem and social self-confidence, and they almost always manage to date and to marry at normally early ages. The only reason why <i class="calibre4"> males</i> with these characteristics do <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> develop strong self-esteem and social self-confidence is that their native characteristics are met with misap-probation by the "powers that be". The "powers that be" define these native characteristics as being the boy's "own fault", and as being in need of fast changing. In girls these characteristics are usually accepted and respected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is instructive to note that our society tends to be a great deal more friendly and helpful towards various forms of maladaptive behavior that are not associated with psychoemotional states of mind. Thus, children with learning disabilities are accorded all manner of special attention. Even normally intelligent children who are very slow in learning to read are given special classes along with quite a bit of one-on-one attention, all of which is aimed at remediating these problems.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We don't tell slow readers: "If we put you in a special class we would be doing you a disservice. This is a competitive world, and the only way you're going to be able to cope with it as an adult is to learn how to cope with it now." Instead we realize that it is only through special training and special attention to specific learning problems that a child will eventually become capable of catching up. (And many slow readers do possess normal-to-above-normal native intelligence.) The same logic applies to the inhibited boy. We need to appreciate the fact that being born inhibited and "slow to warm up" to people socially is directly analogous to being born with some sort of minor learning disability. We don't bully and disparage slow learners the way we disparage shy and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p657"></a>6 2 6 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhibited boys. Instead we provide special classrooms and specially trained teachers to handle all the various forms of major and minor learning disabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The inhibited boy similarly requires special attention. He requires a coeducational learning environment that is gentle, accepting, nonthreatening and noncompetitive. If and when he is accorded this he will stand a reasonable chance of one day being able to compete effectively within the mainstream of society.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Family Structure Factor</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The data uncovered by the research reported in this book also served to emphasize the importance of family composition as a cause of severe loveshyness. First, loveshyness appears to be closely associated with isolation from kin networks. Family kin networks (extended families) that are emotionally close appear to provide very important help services which effectively reduce the probability of severe shyness ever developing among any of their members. Secondly, loveshy men appear to be more likely than most people to have grown up as "only children". Actually most only children do slighty better in life than children who grow up with siblings; and this is especially true for boys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, an incompetent and nonaccepting parent can emotionally damage an only child <i class="calibre4"> (especially</i> if it is a boy) to a far worse extent than he or she could in most cases damage a child with siblings. And that is what the data reported in this book seemed to show.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But the most important finding about family structure concerns <i class="calibre4">sisters. </i> Simply put, severely loveshy men appear to have grown up in isolation from girls in their age range. The non-shys studied for this book were fully five times as likely as the loveshys to have grown up with sisters in the home.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would suggest that all boys need to see girls as regular, non-mysterious human beings. And in this regard I strongly feel that we need to take our cue from Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, and Israeli approaches to socializing young children. In particular, boys from families without sisters need to be accorded a copious abundance of opportunity throughout early and middle childhood (to say nothing of adolescence) to pleasurably and very informally interact with girls in a wide variety of different settings and circumstances. And in regard to this I believe that we need to drop our unhealthy preoccupation with sex and nudity. Religious fundamentalists have wrought a great deal of damage upon our culture in this regard. Sweden, Iceland and Denmark all enjoy greater harmony, stability and security than America does.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some amount of casual nudity and sex play among children is clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p658"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 2 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">not going to destroy a society! Indeed, it is likely to help our society to become stronger through fostering happier, more relaxed, higher quality interpersonal relationships between the sexes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards this end I have recommended the nationwide development of a new recreational organization for children to be called the <i class="calibre4">Coed Scouts. </i> This organization, at least at the outset, would not in any way take the place of the YMCA, YWCA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Boys Club of America, Brownies, Campfire Girls, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Instead, it would be offered as a forward-looking alternative to liberal-minded people and to those who have the responsibility for caring for socially isolated, highly inhibited children. Regular, daily participation in the activities of a Coed Scouting group would serve as a great boon to boys from families without sisters. Simply put, it would foster the kind of social growth that would assure psychoemotional health and possibly even a competitive edge in the dating, courtship and marriage marketplace. (After all, boys who grow up with sisters in their homes seem to enjoy such a competitive edge.) <i class="calibre4">The Abuse Factor</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Another matter of crucial significance from a preventive standpoint is that of properly dealing with school bullies. Up to now the enormously deleterious impact that school bullies have upon the psychoemotional and social growth of inhibited boys has received almost no attention at all from psychologists and educators. Even though bullies may be children, I believe that strong action must be taken in regard to their behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When an adult in our society is arbitrarily and capriciously punched or knocked down he is accorded legal recourse; he can sue for damages on an assault and battery charge. The question naturally arises as to why children (especially <i class="calibre4"> male</i> children) must be forced to suffer physical pain just because they are children and boys! Male children are human beings, and they have feelings the same as any other human being. And yet as a culture we encourage "spanking" by parents as a mode of so-called "discipline", and we overlook and forgive the rank cruelty of the capricious acts taken by classroom bullies. And, of course, we expect our males to become pieces of metal (dispensable pawns) from the standpoint of feelings and emotions when it comes to the "selective slavery"</p>
<p class="calibre1">system and military activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I pointed out in Chapter 24,  <i class="calibre4"> bullying hurts. </i> Among highly inhibited boys it commonly creates lifelong scars, and a lifelong people-avoidance ("people-phobia"). Legal recourse needs to be made available to all male children. And they need to be shown in easy-to-understand language how to bring charges against age-mates who assault them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some people argue that all boys need to get used to "handling bullies",</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p659"></a>6 2 8 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that they need to learn how to defend themselves. And yet bullies (except in criminal muggings) do not single <i class="calibre4"> adults</i> out for such physical abuse. An adult "defends himself" against bullies by consulting with an attorney.  <i class="calibre4"> That</i> is the way defense is supposed to be handled in the United States,  <i class="calibre4"> not</i> by using violence to counteract violence! I believe that our little boys should similarly be taught how to defend themselves by seeking out and employing the coercive power of the law through a licensed attorney.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To summarize my other major recommendations with respect to this issue, I believe that elementary education in the United States must (1) being employing <i class="calibre4"> long-term suspensions</i> for boys who bully; and (2) highly extroverted, hyperactive boys should <i class="calibre4"> not</i> be educated in the same classroom as inhibited boys. Again, lions must not be kept in the same cage with sheep! This is only common sense! Especially in elementary education, teachers often misperceive inhibited boys as being a great deal less intelligent than they actually are. Such counterproductive misconstruals are bound to become less commonplace as teachers become used to dealing with whole classrooms filled with inhibited children.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, I believe that we need to pass laws similar to those in Sweden, which ban all uses of corporal punishment (at home and in school) in "disciplining" children. There are over a score of research based arguments contraindicating the use of physical punishment on human beings. And yet the tradition of corporal punishment continues to be blythly passed on from generation to generation. The Civil Rights laws of the 1960s put a stop to most forms of racial discrimination being passed on from generation to generation. I believe that the law can and should be used with respect to the corporal punishment issue as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">People still rationalize their demonstrably <i class="calibre4"> physical</i> approaches to</p>
<p class="calibre1">"discipline" by saying that "spanking" is the "only way" they can express to the child their caring and concern. Yet an absolute prerequisite for expressing genuine caring and concern is awareness of and sensitivity to the emotional needs and feelings of the child. And, of course, respecting and recognizing a child's needs and feelings does not entail always</p>
<p class="calibre1">"giving in".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many scientists today are beginning to operationalize the very concept of <i class="calibre4"> love</i> as representing the genuine, mutual caring and sensitivity to the feelings and needs of the other person expressed through ongoing, unimpeded communication. Quite clearly, you cannot cause pain to another person and still be sensitive to that person's feelings. Further, such hurtful actions serve to <i class="calibre4"> block</i> meaningful communication and thus <i class="calibre4">reduce</i> actual influence. To be sure, children's behaviors are occasionally exasperating. But in order to erase such behaviors a parent must first</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p660"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 2 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">overtly recognize and respect the need systems which precipitated such outlandish behaviors in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Judging a Person By His Actions</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is almost axiomatic in our society that people are to be judged by their actions. Throughout this book I have stressed the fact that this axiom cannot be used at all in properly dealing with or in understanding the loveshy. Expressed more succinctly,  <i class="calibre4"> you cannot assume that an introvert does not want to do something simply because he is never observed doing</i> <i class="calibre4">it! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, some young people are truly disinterested in heterosexual interaction. And some are very slow in developing any noteworthy heterosexual interests. Loveshy males, however, are definitely <i class="calibre4">not</i> among the ranks of those who tend to be disinterested in informal boy-girl interaction. As the data for this book demonstrated, loveshy males become strongly interested in girls substantially earlier in life than non-shy boys do. But unlike the non-shy, loveshy boys spend much of their time and psychoemotional energies (at school and at home) off in a world of wish-fulfillment fantasies and daydreams. Thus, because they do not enjoy the free choice and self-determination necessary to have a girlfriend <i class="calibre4"> in reality, </i> they create one in fantasy. As this book demonstrated, this tends to be as true for five-year old loveshys as it is for those in their twenties and thirties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parents, teachers and relatives often think that they are doing a favor for the inhibited boy (who only <i class="calibre4"> "appears" </i> to be disinterested in girls) by saying things like "Oh, leave him alone; he's still got plenty of time!" In point of fact, such well-meaning adults are doing a very grave disservice as a result of their <i class="calibre4"> laissez-faire</i> posture. Unless a child presents clear and irrefutable evidence that he is not interested in the opposite sex, ways need to be engineered which effectively facilitate relaxed, comfortable boy-girl interaction. And towards this end I strongly recommend making practice-dating clinics freely and easily available to all children 15-years of age and older. Inhibited boys of younger ages should be tactfully introduced to the nonthreatening "fun" activities of a Coed Scouting group and/or of a Shys Anonymous group.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One point here is completely certain: loveshys <i class="calibre4"> do not</i> have "plenty of time". Time is of the essence in dealing with loveshy males. As this book clearly documented, loveshy males become increasingly worse off as time passes,  <i class="calibre4"> never better\</i> A boy who is loveshy at the <i class="calibre4"> seemingly</i> "youthful" age of 15 will become ten times more severely and intractably loveshy by the time he reaches the age of 30â€”unless someone intervenes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p661"></a>630 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite decisively towards the end of doing something definitive about his problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, "helping him to help himself"  <i class="calibre4"> just won't work! </i> Decisive action must be taken to involve loveshy males in informal activities with girls, <i class="calibre4">and to keep them involved</i> on a daily basis. There must never be any let up in this regard. The loveshy boy must not be left alone until he has arrived at the point wherein he is actually asserting himself in a friendly way vis-a-vis girls and participating fully in the social life of his community.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Misreading Actions and Inactions</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is very interesting to note that up until now homosexuals have received a very great deal more research attention than loveshy heterosexuals. It would appear that a major reason for this is that homosexuals have been widely perceived (incorrectly so) as constituting a threat to the traditional moral order and normative structure. In contrast, loveshys have never been perceived as constituting a threat to anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the time they are small boys in elementary school, loveshys just sit and suffer in silence. Since no one considers them to be a threat, it has not been particularly easy for researchers interested in shyness to secure very much governmental funding for their projects. On the other hand, projects of pertinence to homosexuality have been rather generously funded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One point which came up again and again in this research was the tendency for loveshy males to complain about being misperceived as homosexuals. Most loveshy men tend to be misperceived by all manner of different kinds of people (women and men alike, and homosexuals and heterosexuals alike) as being homosexuals. In fact, quite a few of the loveshys interviewed for this study had reason to believe that even their parents and other major relatives tended to view them as being probable homosexuals.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Extreme care was taken in drawing up the samples for this research to make sure that all of the men studied were of <i class="calibre4"> genuinely heterosexual</i> <i class="calibre4">orientation. </i> Thus, it can be said that loveshy heterosexual men have a very difficult time <i class="calibre4"> commanding their performance</i> on the stage of everyday life. In essence, they do not possess a normal capacity for controlling their behaviors in accordance with their wishes, desires, value systems and goals. As I have expressed it throughout this book, loveshy men lack free choice and self-determination when it comes to friendly assertiveness in most types of informal, unstructured, social situations where there is no purpose apart from pure sociability, and where there is no preordained script or role to play.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p662"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 3 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Herein lies the real tragedy of loveshyness. The fear of anxiety combined with strong inhibition keeps the loveshy man from developing and expressing his humanity. It keeps the loveshy man confined to a kind of prison which inevitably becomes more and more fully and completely escape-proof with each passing year.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Elementary School Children</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">For the present moment, I strongly recommend that all conspicuously shy, timid, socially inhibited elementary school boys be singled out for experimentation with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and/or the tricyclic antidepressant drugs. At the very least, these drugs will operate (most probably in 75 to 85 percent of all cases) to take away the anxiety and fears. Once the social anxieties and "rough and tumble"</p>
<p class="calibre1">fears are removed, the child is free to learn interpersonal skills and at least normal levels of social self-confidence. It should always be remembered that the peer group is one of the two most powerfully important socializing agents. With a mind-state that is free from social fears and timidity, interpersonal interaction in the full-range of children's activities becomes permitted. Once a child is accorded full participation in the mainstream of childish play, he can be assured (as this book has demonstrated) full access to the pleasures of dating, courtship and heterosexual interactionâ€”once his fellow same-sexed buddies become involved in such activities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among high school and university students the MAO Inhibitors and tricyclics may also prove helpful as an accompanyment to practice-dating therapy. But for a smooth sail, high school (and especially college) age is far too late for such psychopharmacological medication. At such advanced ages the young person (1) must be helped to overcome long established habits of social inertia, and (2) must be put through often very difficult interpersonal skills/social self-confidence trainingâ€”training to arrive at a level of performance and affect that his age-mates (com-petitors) had arrived at years before. I think that drug treatment should be used as an <i class="calibre4"> accompanyment</i> to therapy for high school and college males; but such treatment may now represent a <i class="calibre4"> real boon</i> to boys in the age 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">through 12 age bracket.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Postscript</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book was written during the early 1980s. As a futurist I would like to say a few words about how I believe shyness will be cured three or four centuries from now.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p663"></a>6 3 2 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, I believe that the sort of severe shyness dealt with in this book has as its basic origin a disturbance in the electromagnetic energy field which suffuses the body. This electromagnetic energy force field can also be called the "aura" or the bioplasmic body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the severely shy person this electromagnetic energy (aura) field does not intersperse well with the electromagnetic energy fields (auras) of other people. Indeed, it repels other auras to some extent. This is the essence of why from a very early age in life very shy people do not feel comfortable around other people, including age-mates <i class="calibre4"> (people-phobia). </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And it is for this reason that the shy child can be singled out very easily in the kindergarten, nursery school, or elementary school classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This disturbance in the individual's electromagnetic energy force field (which makes convivial sociability <i class="calibre4"> feel</i> unnatural and foreign) is probably rooted in karmic debts; and it is probably created by psychoemotional disturbances inherent in the mother during her pregnancy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is always a strong, karmic link between a mother and her child; and the karmic debts of mother and child are likely to be intertwined.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, as discussed in chapter 6, boys are far more vulnerable than girls are to the plentitude of things which can go wrong during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that treatment for severe shyness five centuries from now will entail acupuncture techniques as well as a certain form of body massage incorporating a special type of quartz crystal. Shyness will be nipped in the bud because afflicted kindergarten five-year olds will be accorded the intensive anti-shyness treatments which they require. Integral to therapeutic treatment will be the taking of frequent Kirlian photographs and movies of the afflicted person's aura. This will serve to closely and effectively monitor therapeutic changes. Changes in the health of a person's aura should accompany and directly parallel changes in the health of overt behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Florin Dumetresco's work at the University of Bucharest has shown that acupuncture points usually light up in a person's Kirlian aura when there is a physiologically based problem, various techniques of acupuncture may thus eventually prove serviceable for the treating of such anxiety-based problems as loveshyness. (See especially the Thelma Moss and Lee Steiner works which are listed in the bibliography.) <b class="calibre3">POSTSCRIPT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Developments While Going to Press</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As of July 1985, extreme shyness and behavioral inhibition constitutes an area of research activity that is beginning to expand fast. This is particularly true concerning research into the genetics, biochemistry</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p664"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 3 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">and physiology of severe shyness and social timidity. And doubtless that is how it should be because if there is to be a final answer to the ultimate <i class="calibre4"> prevention</i> of shyness it is sure to come from such research areas as genetic engineering and engineering of the intrauterine environment of the developing fetus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, Nicholas Zill has just completed a fascinating study that was reported on by Jeff Meer (1985) in a <i class="calibre4"> Psychology Today</i> article. Zill found that 9 percent of 2,279 children between the ages of 7 and 11 whom he interviewed said that they often "felt lonely and wished that they had more friends." By the time <i class="calibre4"> these same children</i> had reached the ages of 12 to 16, fully 10 percent reported being lonely "a lot." Most importantly, almost all of the <i class="calibre4"> same children</i> who were lonely and shy at the ages of 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">through 11, were <i class="calibre4"> still</i> lonely and shy at the ages of 12 through 16,  <i class="calibre4"> five</i> <i class="calibre4">years later. </i> Thus, the conditions of debilitating shyness, inhibition and social timidity tend to be quite stable over time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And in his just published book THE NATURE OF THE CHILD, Jerome Kagan (1984) cites a remarkably similar statistic. He points out that <i class="calibre4"> about 10 percent</i> of American two-year-olds <i class="calibre4"> consistently</i> display an extreme degree of inhibition to nonthreatening but unfamiliar social stimuli involving people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An inhibited but physically healthy child may recover from his social fright (upon the introduction of a stranger into an experimental room) after ten or fifteen minutes. And at that point he might talk and play with the stranger with considerable zeal. This is why Alexander Thomas called this sort of child "slow to warm up to other people" (see chapter 2 of this book). But even though the inhibition is temporary, it is a realiable reaction during the second and third years of life. Among a group of children selected by Garcia-Cole (1984) as extremely inhibited at twenty-one months, fully three-fourths had retained this quality through their fourth birthday. Among the group selected as extremely uninhibited,  <i class="calibre4"> not one</i> had become inhibited by age four.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When each four year old child in Garcia-Coll's experiment played with an unfamiliar child of the same age and sex, the inhibited children rarely approached the peer and typically were passive to attack from the other child. In contrast, the uninhibited children made frequent overtures, occasionally seized toys, and were generally very gleeful and exuberantly active.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When tested by an unfamiliar woman, the inhibited children rarely made interrupting comments. They looked at the examiner frequently and spoke in soft, hesitant voices. In contrast, the uninhibited children interrupted the examiner with questions and irrelevant comments, laughed frequently, and spoke with confident, vital voices.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To unfamiliar or challenging situations, inhibited children (even at preschool ages) display physiological reactions indicating that they are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p665"></a>6 3 4 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">very easily aroused by mild stress. One of these reactions involves the heart. About half of the inhibited children in a study by Kagan (1984), but only 10 percent of the uninhibited ones, manifested higher and more stable heart rates when they were looking at pictures or listening to stories that were a little difficult for them to comprehend.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When a person is relaxed the heart rate displays a cycling that is in phase with his/her breathing. As a person breathes in the heart rate rises; as he/she expires the heart rate normally drops off a bit. This decrease in the heart rate is mediated by the vagus nerve which is under parasympathetic control. However, when a person of any age becomes involved in a task that is perceived as somewhat stressful, the physiological arousal that ensues can inhibit vagal control of the heart rate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And as a result, the heart rate rises slightly and becomes much more stable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This fact suggests that children who usually have higher and more stable heart rates when in new and potentially competitive social situations are (as a result of a genetic basis) more physiologically arousable than the majority of people. Thus, if such afflicted children become aroused in unexpected, unfamiliar, or difficult-to-understand situations, they might well be expected to display an initial and conspicuous degree of caution upon finding themselves in social situations not involving family.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This tendency to become easily aroused by the stresses of daily life was also found in a study by Kagan (1984) to be present in inhibited children during the first year of life. As infants Kagan found inhibited children to have been more irritable than those who later populated the uninhibited, sociable group of children. Also, compared to the uninhibited, the inhibited children as infants displayed a large number of <i class="calibre4">allergic reactions. </i> More succinctly, allergic reactions including an unusually large number of bodily itches can be viewed as constituting symptoms which reflect a much higher than normal level of physiological arousal to harmless stimuli and to everyday events. As I clearly documented in chapter 15 of this book, loveshys are far more likely than non-shys to suffer from a host of allergic sensitivities. Thus, allergic sensitivities may well be precipitated by the same gene as severe shyness. In any case, like behavioral inhibition, allergic reactions appear to represent a behavioral quality that for about 10 percent of the population remains stable across entire liftimes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kagan (1984) studied one group of children from birth to age fourteen, and again as young adults. This group included seven boys who had been extremely inhibited throughout the first three years of their lives. They remained different from the extremely uninhibited boys throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The inhibited males</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p666"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 3 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoided (because of severe shyness) traditional masculine sexual activities, they selected less masculine occupations in adulthood, and as adults were found to be highly introverted and very anxious in new social situations (see also Kagan and Moss, 1983).</p>
<p class="calibre1">An initial behavioral tendency favoring inhibition or lack of inhibition is also believed by Scarr (1969) to be one of the few behavioral dispositions that persists over the long haul of lifeâ€”because it has a strong basis in genetics and body biochemistry. And this body biochemistry impacts the cerebral neurotransmitters in a whole host of ways.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the basic principles of physiology is that each animal species is characterized by a few complementary systems that compete for dominance. The competition between the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems is a good example of competing systems. And it is quite possible that genetic or prenatal influences create conditions which, in some children, promote the sympathetic nervous system to a position of dominance over the parasympathetic nervous system. Such children would be prone towards becoming extremely inhibited, especially if their early environments were somewhat stressful, and if the social norms impacting them prescribe competitive, "rough and tumble"</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Identical twins were found by Plomin and Rowe (1979) to be much more similar in their tendencies to be inhibited or uninhibited than a sample of fraternal twins. This and the many similar findings reported earlier in this book strongly imply genetic imfluence. See also Scarr (1969) for further strong evidence in this regard. On the other hand, Kagan (1984) believes that a biological susceptibility to inhibition may not be actualized in any sort of severe way if the home environment is unusually benevolentâ€”if the child has sensitive, accepting parents and is somehow protected from peer bullying (the most overlooked of all forms of child abuse).</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Energyzing Body Biochemistry of Feeling Good about</i> <i class="calibre4">Oneself</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past fifteen years several researchers have emphasized the point that feeling good about oneself is <i class="calibre4"> energyzing</i> from a biochemical and physiological standpoint. See especially the work of Norman Cousins (1984), and Spencer Johnson (1983) in this regard. It appears that there are chemical concomitants of high self-esteem which serve to promote high and continuing levels of productive activity. By way of contrast, virtually all of the data presented in this book clearly and incisively document the point that loveshy teenagers, young adults and middle-agers tend to be lethargic and very low on physical energy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p667"></a>636 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">In chapter one I discussed an experiment which powerfully documents the energyzing affects of heterosexual love. Simply put, love makes people (and especially males) feel goodâ€”and strongly energizedâ€”</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it makes them feel good about themselves. Being loved in return by someone whom one deeply and sincerely loves is a powerful reinforcer, and it doubtless underlies the popular cliche that there is a woman behind every successful man. The powerfully energyzing properties of heterosexual love constitute a very strong reason for the "powers that be" in society to take action to get severely loveshy males (of all ages) involved in informal heterosexual interaction so that they can find somebody to loveâ€”so that they can become energyzed and perform at their</p>
<p class="calibre1">"peak" best.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Impact of Testosterone on Intrauterine Brain</i> <i class="calibre4">Development of the Fetus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the past several years mounting research evidence has come to the fore which provides strong support for the principles that I delineated in chapter six of this book. Much of this evidence is clearly presented in the first fourteen chapters of a new book titled SEX AND THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">BRAIN, by Jo Durden-Smith and Diane deSimone (1983), which I strongly recommend (together with Wender and Klein's book MIND, MOOD</p>
<p class="calibre1">AND MEDICINE) as "must" reading for anyone genuinely desirous of a full understanding of the root causes of intractable loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Durden-Smith and deSimone place particular emphasis upon the work of East German researcher Gunter Dorner. Simply put, it appears that testosterone has a profound effect upon the brain's three major neurotransmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. These are the three neurotransmitters discussed at length in chapter two, as having a profound impact upon mood and upon relative proneness to anxiety (anxiety threshold).</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sex hormones, and particularly testosterone, profoundly influence brain development, brain structure, and ultimate behavior. Bruce McEwen, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University, has discovered sex hormone receptors during the critical period of <i class="calibre4"> intrauterine development</i> in precisely those areas of the brain which are now believed to organize differences in behavior (between males and females) <i class="calibre4"> other than the sexual,</i> such as the tendency to run away and avoid stress (a "female" response), the tendency to be assertive, competitive and aggressive ("male"</p>
<p class="calibre1">response), <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Most importantly,  <i class="calibre4"> the genetic sex of body tissue is relatively</i> <i class="calibre4">unimportant in terms of ultimate social behavior and preferences. It is the operation of the sex hormones (especially before birth) that is of enormous importance. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p668"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 3 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">Durden-Smith and deSimone (1983) discuss at considerable length the work of Anke A. Ehrhardt and Heino Meyer-Bahlburg of Columbia University. In their in-depth studies of the hormonal environment of the womb, these researchers have focused their attention upon children whose mothers had been given hormones for purposes of pregnancy maintenance. Beginning in the 1950s science developed an increasing ability to manipulate natural hormones and to synthesize new ones.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And over a period of thirty years various versions of these hormones were routeinely dispensed, not only to women at risk for spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, but also to many women who had no reason to need science's help at all. Burgeoning malpractice insurance rates have been one of the key forces behind the increased tendency to employ these hormones on pregnant women, and to require them for giving birth via Cesarean section.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The children born after their mothers had been treated with these hormones differ from controls <i class="calibre4"> only in the circulating sex hormones they were</i> <i class="calibre4">exposed to in the womb. </i> Ehrhardt and Meyer-Bahlburg along with June Reinisch of the Kinsey Institute (Indiana University), and Richard Green of State University of New York at Stony Brook, have tried to tease out the intrauterine effects of these hormones. The case is clearest for the progestogens. Girls who had been exposed intrautero to androgen-based progestogens tended to become a great deal <i class="calibre4"> more tomboyish and energetic</i> than the large majority of unaffected girls; and many of them had been born with subtly masculinized genitals. The affected boys were also found to be much more energetic and aggressive than their peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The reverse of these findings, however, was found to obtain with respect to children affected intrautero by <i class="calibre4"> progesterone-based</i> progestogensâ€”whether administered alone or in combination with estrogens. These hormones had a demonstrably demasculinizing effect.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boys exposed to them as fetuses were found as children to be demonstrably less aggressive and assertive than their male peers. Further, they were found to display poorer athletic coordination and <i class="calibre4"> "lowered masculine</i> <i class="calibre4">interests". </i> The picture was found to be similar for girls whose mothers had been treated with progesterone-based progestogens. They too were found as children to be less active, less verbally aggressive, and less given to energetic play than their peers. Further, the affected <i class="calibre4"> boys</i> and girls were found during the elementary school years to display a preference for female as opposed to male friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of the evidence that is in to date clearly indicates that in humans as well as in monkeys the sex hormones operating in the uterus upon the developing brain are responsible for what might be called <i class="calibre4"> a pretuning</i> <i class="calibre4">of the personality. </i> In essence, the sex hormones organize the social</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p669"></a>638 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">demeanor of the sexes, their orientation to the problems of life and the way they go about solving them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have clearly shown, loveshy men are not homosexual. However, a feminization of sexual orientation appears to be <i class="calibre4"> just one</i> of the things that can go wrong for male children while they are still in the intrauterine environment. Evidently, only some of the sex hormone receptors in the hypothalamus relate to ultimate sexual preferenceâ€”as I suggested in chapter six of this book. Other receptors relate to sex-appropriate behaviors and interests. And evidently, in some male fetuses these can be adversely impacted without the sexual preference receptors being adversely affected (feminized).</p>
<p class="calibre1">We are still a long way from understanding how all of these processes work. However, numerous interesting hints have been issuing from the work of Gunter Dorner. Dorner observed that rats could be rendered homosexual if deprived intrautero of testosterone during the critical period of brain differentiation. Dorner injected a sample of such homosexual rats (as adults) with estrogen. His argument was that if the brains of these rats had indeed been feminized in the intrauterine environment, then their brains would respond as if to a signal from a nonexistent ovary, with a surge of ovulation-inducing hormoneâ€”the so-called luteinizing hormone (LH).  <i class="calibre4"> And they did</i> so. Their brains were indeed feminized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dorner then applied this technique to human male homosexuals and he found the same thing. Their brains responded with this delayed hormonal surge <i class="calibre4"> whereas the brains of a sample of heterosexual males did not. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">During this time Ingeborg Ward at Villanova University had been showing that if you subjected pregnant female rats to stress, then their male offspring would have extremely low levels of testosterone at birth and would exhibit feminized and demasculinized sexual behavior in adulthood. In essence, they would become bisexual or homosexual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dorner repeated her experiment and then looked at the human population to see if there might be a connection between prenatal stress and male homosexuality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First he looked at the records to see whether more male homosexuals had been born during the stressful period of World War II than had been born either before or after it. And he found that there was indeed a very high peak during 1944 and 1945 with regard to homosexuals being born. After having done this, Dorner interviewed a sample of 100 homosexual and bisexual men that was matched with a sample of 100 heterosexual men. And he found that more than two-thirds of the mothers of the homosexuals and bisexuals had been under moderate to quite severe stress during the period that they had been pregnant. In contrast, only about 10 percent of the mothers of the heterosexual men had been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p670"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 3 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">under some stress, and most of their stress was reported as having been quite mild.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of these and other data (some of which was reported in chapter six of this book), Dorner concluded that male homosexuality is the result of permanent neurochemical changes in the hypothalamus effected by reduced levels of testosterone during fetal life. This produces a feminization of the brain which is activated, as far as sexual behavior is concerned, at puberty. The data indicate that <i class="calibre4"> stress in the mother</i> is a major risk factorâ€”which causes the production of substances in the adrenal gland which depress testosterone levels in the male fetus. This and other related factors operate to permanently alter the neural circuitry of the brain, the nerve pathways that are controlled by the local brain hormones, the neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine). These three brain hormones are among the major substances by which individual nerve cells in different parts of the brain communicate with one another across the tiny gap between them (i.e., the <i class="calibre4">synapse). </i> And this particular group of three brain hormones seem to be the local mediators of the effects the sex hormones (particularly testosterone) have on brain cells, and on behavior, throughout life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, one clear way in which heterosexual loveshyness differs from male homosexuality is that the activated sexual interests in loveshys <i class="calibre4"> at puberty</i> are exclusively <i class="calibre4"> heterosexual</i> in nature. However, both before as well as after puberty male loveshys much prefer the idea of playing with girls as opposed to playing with boys; and their recreational interests are (as demonstrated in chapter 10) demonstrably "feminine"</p>
<p class="calibre1">as far as our cultural definitions are concerned. Further, heterosexual loveshys (as per the data presented in chapter 11) appear to have <i class="calibre4"> always</i> been deeply romantically oriented both <i class="calibre4"> before</i> as well as after pubescence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This strong, preadolescent need for pair-bonding with a romantic lover does not appear to be a consistent earmark of homosexual males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why it is prudent to speculate upon the existence of <i class="calibre4"> different</i> sex hormone receptors in the brain which respond to these chemicals during intrauterine life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evidently, the impact of the sex hormones <i class="calibre4"> at puberty</i> is quite different for male homosexuals than it is for male heterosexual loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is because certain sex hormone receptors in homosexuals had been pretuned well before birth, whereas in the latter these same sex hormone receptors had not been pretuned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, male homosexual and heterosexual loveshys appear to have numerous important traits in common. And an attribute of the most important sort which they appear to have in common is the history of having been feminized intrautero by the subjectivity perceived prenatal stress of a hypertensive mother.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p671"></a>6 4 0 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is now possible to demonstrate that the levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are quite dramatically altered in different areas of the brain as a result of prenatal stress in both male and female rats. In fact, it has recently been shown that not only the male but also the female offspring of prenatally stressed mothers have (1) altered levels as adults of these neurotransmitters, and (2) a poor reproductive capacity. The latter is manifested by irregular estrus cycle, low sexual receptivity, difficulty becoming pregnant, tendency to spontaneously abort, and failure to produce sufficient milk for offspring. To be sure, extrap-olating from rats to humans is always risky. But these research results must be viewed as strongly suggestive.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Testosterone in humans gives rise to a number of behavioral effects quite in addition to that of merely increasing level of aggression and assertiveness. A number of studies have suggested that testosterone increases behavioral reactivityâ€”the opposite of the inhibition which loveshys display. But more importantly, it has also been found to alleviate fatigue. As I have indicated in chapter 15, severely shy men tend to be quite lacking in energy; they suffer from frequent periods of fatigue which get in the way of their ability to show persistent effort even in activities they enjoy, much less in those wherein there is opposition requiring some degree of competition. The fact that loveshys tend to have an above average amount of difficulty getting up out of bed in the morning can be seen as further illustrative of low energy and perhaps a diminished sensitivity to testosterone in areas of the brain that should react to testosterone but cannot do so because they were inadequately primed for it before birth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob Goy of the primate lab at University of Wisconsin, Madison, has provided some further data which has a suggestive bearing upon the development of loveshyness in males. Goy has studied dominance patterns among rhesus monkeys, and he has shown that females whose mothers were given testosterone during pregnancy are much more likely to be the dominant members of a mixed troup as adults than are other, untreated females.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Goy has highlighted four major ways in which male rhesus monkeys at young ages differ in their behavior from females: (1) they initiate play more often, (2) they roughhouse more often, (3) they mount peers of both sexes more often, and (4) they mount their mothers more often than females do. But interestingly, Goy has been able to produce a male-typical frequency of all of these behaviors in young females by giving their pregnant mothers thigh injections of testosterone for various periods of time during the critical period of development which in rhesus monkeys as in humans is before birth. As a result of such treatment the young females will play rough and will act assertively.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p672"></a>Some Final Thoughts  6 4 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of Goy's testosterone-treated female monkeys tend to be born with somewhat masculinized genitals. Thus, there is clearly a critical prenatal period for the formation of genitals. But far more interesting is the fact that there also appears to be a <i class="calibre4"> critical period</i> for every one of the four sex-specific behaviors delineated above. In essence, there is a critical period in intrauterine development during which the sex hormones affect every single one of these "sex-appropriate" behaviors. Given the many similarities between rhesus monkeys and man (both primates), these findings may well hold considerable implications for the intractable passivity which male (human) loveshys display. Further, these findings suggest that the individual traits which comprise masculinity are separately controlled,  <i class="calibre4"> over time, </i> by the sex hormones. The masculinization of the brain which takes place before birth is thus a slow, complicated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">"more-or-less" type process. Hence, you can get some males which are born with highly aggressive play tendencies, and you get others that are born less "masculine".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, there are two biological forces which conspire in a synergistic way with the environment to give rise to severe shyness: (1) genes, and (2) congenital forces operating before birth. The genes can be seen as constituting interlocking sets of potentials and predispositions. The congenital variables highlight the importance of the hormonal and immune environment of the womb. Once born, of course, the feminized male child exudes (through no "free choice" fault of his own) and becomes a victim of an adverse <i class="calibre4"> social stimulus value</i>â€”as per my detailed discussion in chapter three.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">It's Time to Take the Problem of Shyness Seriously</i> In the July 1985, issue of PSYCHOLOGY TODAY, British psychologist Peter Harris (of University of Nottingham) emphasizes that a key reason some people experience so much trouble and unhappiness in overcoming their shyness is that most people simply do not take the shyness problem seriously. Indeed, shyness <i class="calibre4"> (especially in males)</i> vis-a-vis the opposite sex fails to excite feelings of sympathy and compassion, except in very few people. It is deeply and sincerely hoped that this book will begin to greatly change all that. Through reading and studying the numerous case reports presented in this book it is hoped that the public (and particularly those involved as teachers and administrators at <i class="calibre4"> all levels</i> of education) will at long last begin to appreciate how enormously and excruciatingly painful and life-debilitating shyness, and especially <i class="calibre4"> "loveshyness" </i> can be. Once the seriousness of the problem is fully realized by people of some influence, the effective modes of therapy and prevention discussed in this book can begin to be aggressively pursued on behalf of the victims.</p>
