<p class="calibre1"><a id="p551"></a>520 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">matchmaking activity done by a therapist on behalf of a shy person is merely a "cop out". (The coloquial term "cop out" has become for most psychotherapists a kind of "pat" rejoinder for <i class="calibre4"> any</i> idea of which they disapprove. Utter the words "cop out" and it automatically becomes unnecessary to use the <i class="calibre4"> thinking faculty</i> for coming up with a <i class="calibre4"> real</i> argument of rejoinder.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">The practice-dating therapist, like most other <i class="calibre4"> behavior therapists,</i> believes that people learn <i class="calibre4"> by doing, </i> and that the longer the loveshy remain uninvolved in social activities, the more socially incompetent they are likely to become—and the more poorly they are likely to think of themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The behavior therapist believes in extinguishing destructive anxiety reactions (like loveshyness) by gradually and continually exposing the client to the anxiety-provoking social stimulus (i.e.,  <i class="calibre4"> women), </i> and by assuring that these exposures are systematically controlled in such a way that <i class="calibre4"> (l)none of them</i> are too threatening or anxiety-provoking for a particular loveshy client, and (2) that each one provides for the experiencing of strong feelings of pleasure and accomplishment. Most importantly, a behavior therapist believes that a person cannot lift himself up by his own bootstraps if he has no bootstraps to begin with. Behavior therapy (practice-dating) provides the bootstraps. Thus, it is <i class="calibre4"> a form of socialization</i> <i class="calibre4">process</i> which, upon completion, assures that the client will be able to get all of his essential needs met—that he will be able to competently accomplish goals for himself (like securing a wife) that he could not do before the therapy had begun.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Traditional therapists typically believe (by action if not by intellectual conviction) in forcing square pegs into round holes, and in catalyzing people into "adjusting" their personalities <i class="calibre4"> to the way things are. </i> Hence, most of them are socially and politically conservative; e.g., "society's alright; it's the patient who must change". Most traditional therapists are "wedded" (intractably committed) to one or another "talking cure"</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective. And if a client does not respond positively, then there must be something wrong with the client: e.g., "too many defenses", "he's not ready yet", "he <i class="calibre4"> enjoys</i> resisting treatment", <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> The idea that there might be something wrong with the perspective itself—or that a certain perspective simply <i class="calibre4"> does not "fit" </i> a particular client—is something that never seriously enters the mind of the conventional psychotherapist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, it is against their <i class="calibre4"> vested interests</i> for such an idea to enter their minds. Simply put, the operating assumption of most traditional psychotherapists is that the perspective they are using <i class="calibre4"> fits everyone. </i> In the nutshell, THIS IS WHY CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES HAVE INVARIABLY FAILED QUITE MISERABLY IN THE TREATMENT OF SEVERELY LOVESHY MEN who had been born with the inhibition and low anxiety threshold genes.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p552"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 521</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Practice-Dating and the University Campus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If your university campus does not offer practice-dating therapy, I suggest that you frame some well-written letters to your student newspaper about it. Contact the student body president, the local community newspaper, local television and radio stations, religious leaders of moderate denominations—as many different kinds of people as you can.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indicate to them that practice-dating therapy is greatly needed. Give them a copy of this book. Make it clear that practice-dating provides for by far the highest "cure rate" of all therapeutic approaches in dealing with severely loveshy men. And indicate your sincere belief that loveshy men have as much right as anybody to enjoy the good life, to be able to enjoy dating, courting, to be able to marry and to enjoy active involvement in a rewarding social life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the present time there is a shortage of academic positions for psychologists. However, if enough pressure was brought to bear, advertisements could be placed in the CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION, and in certain employment periodicals of the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Psychiatric Association, for academic/clinical and/or counseling psychologists and psychiatrists <i class="calibre4"> with a special competence in the administration of practice-dating therapy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, it should now be possible to insist that all university campuses have someone readily available at all times who has a professional competence in the specialized area of practice-dating therapy. Remember the old saying that "the customer is always right". Colleges and universities are literally begging for customers, even to the point of having to advertise on television and in all other media. A sales organization must please its customers if it is to stay in business and to flourish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The readily availability of practice-dating therapy could be a formidable boon to any college or university. If such a program were well advertised, loveshys from all over would want to go there and matri-culate on a full-time basis. Loveshy people are customers; and as <i class="calibre4"> consumers</i> of higher education they need to make clear to the sales organizations delivering educational services just exactly what their needs and requirements are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For several very good reasons it is perfectly legitimate and reasonable to expect that all campuses with 2,500 or more students have a practice-dating therapist readily at hand. For example, we know that the loveshy are underachievers who cannot concentrate on their work anywhere nearly as well as they could if they had the sense of personal freedom necessary to enjoy female companionship, dating and courtship, and to lead a well-balanced, diversified life. Hence, even hard nosed academics can be convinced on the basis of available empirical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p553"></a>522 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">research data that academic goals can be more readily and effectively achieved by students who possess a sense of personal freedom about the governance of their personal lives, and who are able to initiate and to sustain meaningful heterosexual love relationships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If there is a shortage of already trained therapists in the specialized field of practice-dating, then the large scale appearance of a surfeit of employment ads requiring practice-dating therapists will assure that a plethora of graduate programs in psychology, psychiatry and social work focusing on practice-dating will commence to sprout up so that the demand can be fulfilled. Indeed,  <i class="calibre4"> it can be guaranteed that this will happen! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the pay and the various other rewards are right, the employment needs and requirements of an organization tend to be met quite rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Some Militancy Needs to be Displayed</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If in seeking therapeutic help for your loveshyness you end up in a so-called "shyness clinic" where you are told that for your homework exercise you have to go out and "start a conversation with a stranger", <i class="calibre4">WALK OUT! </i> Remember that <i class="calibre4"> you</i> are the customer! And it is up to the deliverer of a service to correctly ascertain customer wants and to satisfy them. As I have already stressed, "shyness clinic" therapy is totally worthless from the standpoint of successfully remedying chronic and severe loveshyness problems. And the same is true for the various</p>
<p class="calibre1">"assertiveness training" programs and encounter groups that are operated, and in which the loveshy often get "roped in".</p>
<p class="calibre1">We know today that practice-dating is the therapeutic direction which offers the greatest hope for the severely loveshy. Hence, practice-dating therapy is the therapeutic modality which must be insisted upon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And corollatively, we must insist upon the development of graduate programs in psychology that work to create practitioners who are properly educated to competently fulfill this demand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, this same militancy is required to an even greater extent vis-a-vis traditional psychotherapeutic practitioners who insist upon using one or another of the "talking cures". Psychoanalysis, client-centered therapy, rational-emotive therapy, etc., will simply not work for severely loveshy men. Similarly, the various forms of conventional group therapy are also a waste of time and often do more harm than good inasmuch as they commonly arouse a tremendous amount of hostility and backbiting among the component members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men would do well to find others with problems similar to their own. There is safety in numbers as well as political power and clout. Heterosexual loveshys remain pretty much the only minority group without a political power base. To be sure, a loveshy man in almost all cases would be far too shy and inhibited to take strong political action</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p554"></a>Practice-Dating Therapy 523</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his own. But in the company of other loveshys it is likely that a considerable fraction of loveshys could fight for their rights quite vociferously and with a steadfast attitude. This is especially true for that 30</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent of loveshy males whose shyness does not extend to public speaking or to a range of <i class="calibre4"> impersonal</i> type social interactions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, when one is fighting for one's rights there <i class="calibre4"> is</i> a purpose apart from pure, unadulterated sociability. Therefore, when loveshys are joined together with many others of like mind, there is no reason why a significant minority of them should feel shy or inhibited. Of course, inertia can be a problem inasmuch as a long history of no success at all in the social realm of life can and usually does lead to a feeling of weariness and a concomitant disinclination to take any action at all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why the locating of other men with loveshyness problems can serve as a powerful catalyst to effective political action. For example, on a university campus a group of only five or six loveshy men could attract considerable notice to themselves by peacefully marching and carrying placards in and around the administration building and/or student counseling center and departments of psychology and of journalism/</p>
<p class="calibre1">media studies. These placards could back up articles and "letters to the editor" published in the university newspapers. And they could contain such slogans as: PRACTICE-DATING THERAPY <i class="calibre4"> NOW; </i> MALE LESBIANS UNITE! LOVESHY PRIDE; SHY PRIDE; CLOSET HETEROSEXUALS UNITE! HETEROSEXUAL LOVESHYS UNITE! LOVESHYS</p>
<p class="calibre1">NEED LOVE TOO; LOVESHYS UNITE; PASSIVE COWARDICE IS A VIRTUE: PASSIVE COWARDS DON'T MAKE WAR! <i class="calibre4">etc.</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, I am not recommending that loveshys become obstreperous rabel-rousers. It is highly unlikely that any of them would have the psychoemotional capacity to do this anyway. What I am recommending is that they take steps to become more politically aware and less politically inconspicuous. If homosexuals can march around insisting upon their rights and chanting "Gay Pride", then it is clear that heterosexual loveshys might be able to make some real progress on their own behalf by similarly banding together with others who share their problem and handicap.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Homosexuals have made some formidable progress over the past fifteen years. And much of this progress can be directly attributable to their vociferously bringing the unfairness of their plight to public attention <i class="calibre4"> (including</i> the solicitation of <i class="calibre4"> media</i> attention). Even in large cities, homosexual men used to be discriminated against to a far greater extent than they are today. Yet if the heterosexual loveshy man stops to ponder the issue for a moment he will realize that he has been discriminated against and ignored in a whole host of ways to a far greater extent than homosexual men have ever been discriminated against or ignored. Homosexual men have places to go. They have a whole host of publications</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p555"></a>524 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">which advise them of gathering places, counseling services, bars, support groups, medical services, gay baths, recreational events, political groups, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In short, there are organizations designed to help homosexuals establish a social network of meaningful friendships.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I have stressed throughout this book, heterosexual loveshy men <i class="calibre4"> lack</i> any social networks. They are isolates who had always been ignored and made surplus garbage (dispensable pawns) by society. They are probably the only major category of people in American society that <i class="calibre4">lacks</i> any organized group or publication to look after and defend their rights and needs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And so marching about with placards would (1) make it far easier for other <i class="calibre4"> closet heterosexuals</i> and <i class="calibre4"> male lesbians</i> (heterosexual loveshy men) to come out of the closet and meet and plan strategies with others of like mind and experience. In short, it would help loveshys to get together and make friends with people of their own temperament. It would enable them to establish themselves in meaningful social networks and make their <i class="calibre4"> existence</i> (along with their basic human needs) known to society through the mass media of radio, television, and newspapers. In fact, I can guarantee that the television cameras would soon be around if a fair sized bunch of heterosexual loveshys marched together carrying placards with statements similar to those designated above. Television news reporters are always on the alert for what appears to be unusual and intrinsically interesting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly (2), such peaceful marching about would have the effect of alerting university administrators to the needs of their campus and local communities. Sooner or later they would have to take some action by way of bringing in trained and competent practice-dating therapists, and perhaps nude jacuzzi and sexual surrogate therapists as well. At the very least, authority figures would be made aware of the <i class="calibre4"> existence</i> of a group of highly deprived people whose needs have been totally ignored for far too long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And finally (3), the public attention that such marching would attract would render it increasingly easy to develop local chapters of a soon-to-be nationwide (support group) organization called <i class="calibre4"> Shys Anonymous</i> or <i class="calibre4"> (LoveShys Anonymous). </i> Indeed,  <i class="calibre4"> Coed Scouting</i> organizations for children and teenagers might similarly be launched in this way.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Indeed, since practice-dating groups are really <i class="calibre4"> support groups</i> (along the "AA"</p>
<p class="calibre1">model), men and women who have been fully graduated from regular participation in practice-dating are <i class="calibre4"> also</i> encouraged to look in on and help anxious neophytes who might occasionally be too nervous to show up for meetings or assigned dates.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p556"></a>Chapter 23</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Some Therapeutic Adjuncts</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There are several therapeutic modalities which can and most probably should be used as concomitants to practice-dating therapy. The purpose of this chapter is two-fold: (1) to discuss the therapeutic adjuncts that are likely to accomplish the greatest good for loveshy men and women; and (2) to delineate the most important rejoinders to those who would assert that practice-dating is not a suitable therapeutic modality for the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Nude Jacuzzi Experience</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A jacuzzi bath is a circular bath tub approximately two feet deep, which is large enough to accommodate some six or eight people. It is characterized by warm, vigorously swirling waters which constantly move, and which remain quite comfortably warm but not hot. In recent years it has become a very helpful psychotherapeutic device. And it has become recognized as a sure-fire socio-sexual "ice breaker" and as a highly effective social relaxant. A high quality jacuzzi bath will easily permit eight people of both sexes to climb in and enjoy the quite unique, disinhibiting sensations. Indeed, an invitation to jacuzzi bathing has been found by numerous therapists to almost always make it very easy for even comparatively shy people to shed their clothes quite rapidly amid mixed company.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacuzzi bathing typically provides an intrinsically very sensual experience for all who participate. Physiologically, the warm swirling water tends to raise blood pressure and to give rise to an unmistakable</p>
<p class="calibre1">"high" feeling. Thus, besides turning everybody on, jacuzzi bathing is intrinsically disinhibiting. It makes it unusually easy for most if not all participants to let down whatever psychoemotional defenses they might have brought with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After just a few minutes in a bath with a collection of nude friends of both sexes even the most reserved participant is likely to giggle and 525</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p557"></a>526 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">laugh and almost totally lose any feelings of reserve that he or she might have had upon initially arriving on the scene. Herein lies the basic psychotherapeutic thrust of the nude jacuzzi experience. And herein lies the reason why an increasing number of therapists interested in treating shyness are finding the jacuzzi to be of enormous value in dealing with inhibited teenagers and young adults. During the past few years some very promising work with coeducational nude psychotherapy has been done utilizing jacuzzi baths. Therapists report that the warm, swirling water greatly facilitates therapeutic social interaction, and that even the most intractably shy man becomes remarkably disinhibited by the middle of the third jacuzzi bath session, at the latest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Better than half of the loveshy men I interviewed indicated that they <i class="calibre4"> would be willing</i> to experience coeducational nude jacuzzi therapy as part of an optional set of exercises engaged in during the twice-weekly practice-dating group therapy meetings. Up to now very few practice-dating therapists have had the guts to incorporate nude jacuzzi therapy into their armamentarium of therapeutic skills. This is doubtless because up to now virtually all practice-dating therapy has been conducted in college and university environments wherein conservative boards of regents and administrators have had to be contended with. However, the success of nude jacuzzi therapy at places like Escalan (Big Sur, California), has convinced me that it would represent an extremely powerful <i class="calibre4">and extremely beneficial</i> therapeutic adjunct. To be sure, it would be counterproductive to require participation in nude jacuzzi therapy as a prerequisite for continued participation in practice-dating therapy. However, nude jacuzzi group therapy <i class="calibre4"> should</i> be made available to all practice-dating clients. All should be gently and tactfully encouraged to take part by experienced practice-daters of both genders. (It is, of course, surprisingly easy to be nude when everyone of both sexes in your immediate social environment is also nude.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unwritten university policies (and most of the feared policies <i class="calibre4"> are</i> unwritten and <i class="calibre4"> not</i> official) can be circumvented by holding biweekly jacuzzi sessions at off-campus locations. Non-university psychologists would have to be retained for leading the nude group jacuzzi sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, at the outset it might be best if the regular, university-affiliated practice-dating therapist was not the person to actually conduct these.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Participants would undoubtedly have to pay some fee for the nude jacuzzi therapy service. But I am convinced that the experience and the consequent therapeutic gains would be well worth the asking price.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nude jacuzzi therapy is especially helpful in getting the severely loveshy person over what was earlier described as the "second plateau"</p>
<p class="calibre1">of shyness. It represents an additional highly valuable catalyst for facilitating the dropping of a rigid set of defenses and the baring of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p558"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 527</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression of true feelings. In short, nude jacuzzi therapy can greatly facilitate the loveshy towards the ultimate goal of truly being themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parenthetically, among men and women who have commenced sexual activity with each other, the jacuzzi experience provides a kind of "built in" form of birth control. Research at the Claremont Colleges in California has shown that when the testicles are kept submerged under hot water for five minutes or more (and a nude jacuzzi session usually lasts for at least 50 minutes), the sperm in a man's scrotum are all killed off and he becomes quite infertile for a period of several hours.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been speculated that this may be one reason why middle-class people have always had smaller families than poor people. Middle-class people have always been more likely than the poor to bathe prior to making love.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Therapy Employing Sexual Surrogates</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Any truly comprehensive program calculated to guarantee a complete cure for intractable, chronic and severe loveshyness MUST incorporate a program facet that entails use of sexual surrogates. At the outset I want to stress that sex surrogate therapy is <i class="calibre4"> only a facet or component</i> of what I believe would comprise a thoroughly effective program for the curing of <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of even the most stubbornly loveshy men. Sexual surrogate therapy would never work <i class="calibre4"> by itself</i> to relieve a person of intractable loveshyness. Indeed, it might render a severely loveshy man emotionally capable of satisfying himself with prostitutes but as emotionally incapable as he ever was of developing an intimate relationship with an eligible, potential marriage partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as sexual surrogate therapy is not being recommended here as a sole therapeutic modality for the extremely shy, it is being strongly and enthusiastically recommended as a necessary and perhaps <i class="calibre4">indispensable adjunct</i> to practice-dating therapy. The United States is still very far from being a sex positive society. Even today there are so many people who are quite uncomfortable about most topics and issues of a sexual nature. And this is why the sexual surrogate component to the loveshys' therapeutic package that is being recommended by this book necessitates some very strong defensive efforts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Briefly, a sexual surrogate is a young woman who has been trained in techniques of helping men to overcome various sexual problems such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and inability to please a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today hundreds of sexual surrogates are employed in various sex therapy clinics throughout the United States. About 60 percent of the clientele served by these women are married; the other 40 percent are single</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p559"></a>528 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">and divorced. In the majority of instances sexual surrogates work directly under the supervision of a certified clinical psychologist or psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, in recent years a small number of sexual surrogates have themselves completed the Ph.D. and licensing training that is necessary to running their own operation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now the rate of success eminating from the work of sexual surrogates has been extremely high. In fact, some studies show that the surrogates have provided very valuable help to virtually every man whom they have seen. The first American clinic to employ sexual surrogates was operated by the famous Masters and Johnson sex research team in St. Louis, Missouri. And they too have reported remarkable success rates over the years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, what is of especial importance from the standpoint of this book is the fact that sexual surrogates working under the auspices of licensed clinical psychologists have been enormously successful in helping <i class="calibre4"> male virgins</i> in the 28 to 40-year old age group. Indeed, one of the major categories of people up to now to have sought therapy from sexual surrogates has been the chronically loveshy, single-never-married, male virgin in the 28 to 40-year old age range.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, there is a valuable side benefit which seems to accrue from sexual surrogate therapy with the severely loveshy. Thus, this form of therapy seems to have the effect of substantially weakening the loveshys' need for a woman with the classical "long hair and youthful, pretty face" syndrome. As I have documented, the loveshys' needs and requirements relative to feminine beauty tend to be both rigid and highly unrealistic. Further, these demands constitute a major reason as to why loveshy men have no interest in approaching or talking to or in initiating relationships with most women. Insofar as sexual surrogate therapy has the effect of sharply reducing the strength of these unrealistic needs, it is thus removing a major impediment to informal heterosexual interaction for the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, anxieties pertinent to <i class="calibre4"> having sex</i> are not synonymous with heterosexual (social) interaction anxieties. None of the 300 loveshy men studied for this book had ever had sex with anyone other than themselves (masturbation). And loveshy men must learn how to self-disclose vis-a-vis a woman in a comfortable, serene way. They must learn how to relax and to enjoy emotional sharing with another human being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what appears to happen in therapy involving sexual surrogates is that THE EXTINCTION OF ANXIETIES PERTAINING TO HAVING</p>
<p class="calibre1">SEX <i class="calibre4"> TRANSFERS</i> INTO THE SIMULTANEOUS EXTINCTION OF</p>
<p class="calibre1">HETEROSEXUAL-SOCIAL INTERACTION ANXIETIES! In other words, general interpersonal anxieties regarding informal interaction vis-a-vis</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p560"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 529</p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive members of the opposite sex appear to be almost fully extinguished by and through the process of extinguishing sexual anxieties.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this applies as much to virginal men who have never made love to a woman in their lives, as it does to married men who had been suffering sexual difficulties prior to treatment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These new and provocative findings raise a question that is of enormous importance for the proper therapeutic treatment of the virginal loveshy. In particular,  <i class="calibre4"> a man's sexual anxieties and fears may to a greater</i> <i class="calibre4">or lesser extent lie at the very heart of his anxieties pertinent to informal socializing vis-a-vis women. </i> And if this is indeed the case (and the available evidence is pointing in that direction), then any therapy for the loveshy which stands a good chance for <i class="calibre4"> lasting</i> success is going to have to come to grips with the <i class="calibre4"> sexual</i> anxieties problem. In short, the capacity of the loveshy for (1) developing interpersonal self-confidence and finesse for successful heterosexual interaction, and (2) for overcoming heterosexual interaction anxieties which obviate meaningful socializing with women, may rest in large part upon their ability to overcome their specifically <i class="calibre4"> sexual</i> anxieties vis-a-vis the female sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In view of the foregoing, I would recommend that therapy incorporating use of sexual surrogates be made available to <i class="calibre4"> all</i> loveshy men 18-years of age and older. All major university campuses and all major urban clinics should have sexual surrogate programs readily available to all men who present evidence that they have suffered from chronic and severe loveshyness. These programs need to receive the same level of federal and state funding as do other medical and mental health programs for, as I have clearly documented, chronic loveshyness has a profound impact upon all levels of emotional <i class="calibre4"> and physical</i> health.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Right now therapy involving the use of sexual surrogates sells for $75 to $100 per 90-minute session; and programs claiming success at curing the chronically loveshy seem to require about 30 sessions of work over some 30 weeks time. This price structure is obviously far beyond the means of most afflicted young men. And so steps need to be taken to incorporate it under the regular, normal health insurance programs that presently embrace all the medical/psychiatric health needs and requirements of most university students. Inasmuch as only 1.5 percent of all university males suffer from severely intractable loveshyness, it appears evident that sexual surrogate therapeutic programs would not be widely used by the general run of young men. Under conditions of careful psychiatric screening, men with little need for the program can easily be kept out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Programs claiming success with the chronically loveshy ordinarily run for a full 30 weeks. In most cases the men involved in these programs had never been nude with a woman in their lives. And they had never</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p561"></a>530 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen a nude woman apart from what they might have observed in "skin flicks" or "nudie" magazines. None of them had ever looked at the genitals of a real, live woman; and none felt at all comfortable about either their own potential nudity or that of a possible female partner.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first several weeks of the typical program does not entail any nudity. Instead the surrogate works with the loveshy man on what have come to be known as "sensate focus" exercises. Sensate focus is a sort of relaxing meditation. The client closes his eyes, relaxes, and concentrates very deeply upon the feelings of touch that he is experiencing from the touching and massaging activities of the surrogate. The first several weeks may focus primarily on hand-holding and hand caressing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After the client begins to feel reasonably "at home" with that, they move on to the caressing of other parts of the body. Usually it takes until the fourth or fifth week before the surrogate successfully moves the client on to the point wherein both he and she can remove their clothes (bathing trunks).</p>
<p class="calibre1">At the outset a jacuzzi bath may be used as a catalyst to facilitate helping the very shy young man come to grips with the fact of being nude in the same room with a nude woman. Of course, all the while this is going on the young man is learning something about conversational skills with a woman. And he is also learning about various physical pleasuring skills. He is learning how to translate his highly sensitive attitudes towards women <i class="calibre4"> into action</i> of a type that will benefit both himself and a future female love partner whom he will later be emotionally equipped to pick out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With each advancing session the sensate focus exercises continue.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man gradually learns how to relax as the surrogate commences pleasuring each increasingly intimate part of his body. And simultaneously he learns <i class="calibre4"> (by doing)</i> how to effectively pleasure the increasingly intimate parts of a woman's body. Exercises leading up to and involving actual sexual intercourse may not necessarily commence until the twentieth session or later. After that time the young man may go through the various stages of foreplay and copulate with his surrogate two or even three times during the course of the 90-minute therapy period.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These exercises are a necessary and, in fact, indispensable part of the program and of its ultimate therapeutic success. Moralists have criticized (not unexpectedly!) all therapeutic programs involving sexual surrogates as constituting a thinly-veiled form of prostitution. Of course, moralists by their very nature have always been uncomfortable with all non-marital manifestations of sexuality anyway. Thus, they can be accurately deemed part of the loveshyness problem in American society,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p562"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 531</p>
<p class="calibre1">NOT of its solution! Moralists need to be advised of the fact that in order for a loveshy man to attain that ultimate goal of a lasting marriage (which they themselves so enthusiastically exalt), they must allow that loveshy man to experience whatever therapeutic regime the best empirical research points to as being best at painlessly and successfully conquering the loveshyness problem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, prostitutes as they currently exist in America today could not be led to accomplish the types of exercises that sexual surrogates do every day at the direction of licensed clinical psychologists and psychiatrists. Most prostitutes have an underlying hostility and dislike for the male gender. And even though some prostitutes have developed reputations for being remarkably effective "talking therapists" of real compassion and understanding, these are the exception rather than the rule. Further, the amount of time a prostitute normally alots each client is far too limited for a severely loveshy man to achieve any lasting benefits. The prostitute is normally oriented towards sexual intercourse only—or towards whatever sexual maneuver will successfully bring a male client to climax as efficiently and rapidly as possible. Simply put, all that has been learned over the past two decades about the profound therapeutic impact of sensate focus exercises would likely be lost on the prostitute. Her business does not allow her to very patiently pursue the slow, systematic course <i class="calibre4"> with the same loveshy man</i> over a 30-week course of time. And, by the way, none of the 300 loveshy men studied for this research had ever so much as even considered going to see a prostitute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, loveshy men view prostitutes with a sense of fear; they fear being "taken" financially, and they fear sexual embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One potential problem with severely loveshy men is that they might be especially vulnerable to "falling in love" with the sexual surrogate. Needing love so badly, it is not difficult to understand why the loveshy might be particularly vulnerable towards developing a deep-seated infatuation with anyone of the female gender who shows them genuine compassion and sincere, personal interest.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffice it to say that comfortable ways have been developed for keeping the loveshy man from falling in love with the surrogate. In fact, along about the 15th week of treatment he is strongly encouraged to begin dating. Of course, young men in practice-dating therapy would already be dating anyway. For them sexual surrogate therapy would merely be an important adjunct to the basic practice-dating program.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And that is essentially what I am recommending.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, those receiving sexual surrogate therapy who are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> simultaneously involved in a practice-dating program would be strongly urged to enroll in a reputable dating service or marriage bureau, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p563"></a>532 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">permit themselves to meet women through that. This would be especially true for men who remain too shy to socially assert themselves vis-a-vis women even after 15 weeks of sexual surrogate therapy. Of course, in most cases after the standard thirty weeks of sexual surrogate therapy even the most severely loveshy men are going to be dating and informally socializing with women. And they will be doing this in a way that is far more comfortable and emotionally rewarding for them than anything they had ever up to that point in their lives experienced.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, I am not claiming here that therapy incorporating sexual surrogates is any kind of a panacea. In fact, I personally believe that this form of therapy needs to be employed as a simultaneous <i class="calibre4"> adjunct</i> to other forms of therapy, and particularly (under <i class="calibre4"> ideal</i> circumstances) to practice-dating therapy. However, sexual surrogate therapy with its accent on sensate focus exercises and on learning how to feel at home with the physical expressions of love, can and will make a powerful contribution to the ultimate "cure" of any loveshy man. Such therapy can do wonders in getting a person past the barriers and stumbling blocks posed by the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"second plateau" </i> of loveshyness. Programs which do not involve use of sexual surrogates stand less chance of ultimate and lasting success than those which do. And, of course, that is the ultimate acid test.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, we must not permit moralists to limit the use of sexual surrogate therapy to the ranks of older men. I believe that the kind of severe loveshyness from which the 35 to 50-year old male virgins of this study suffered could have been prevented from reaching such enormous proportions had these men been placed in sexual surrogate therapy programs when they had been 18 or 19 or 20 years old. Indeed, had these men received practice-dating therapy on top of sexual surrogate therapy, it is highly unlikely that any of them would still be loveshy today.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Use of Audio-Cassette Programs</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating therapy programs often incorporate use of certain audio-cassette programs. Such recorded programs are often used in more conventional "shyness clinic" work as well. In practice-dating their use can and often does function on a subliminal level as an effective catalyst speeding and facilitating the remission of destructive symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Certain programs have been found to be especially helpful in this regard. The object of the most effective programs is to inspire the listener into programming his/her subconscious mind with more positive, life-enhancing self-images. Thus, the loveshy male is shown the powerful impact that <i class="calibre4"> mind</i> can have over "matter", and how a person tends to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p564"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 533</p>
<p class="calibre1">become what he/she thinks about most of the time. Used by themselves these cassette programs provide little more than an intellectually stimulating experience. However, when they are used in conjunction with a therapeutic regimen with which the loveshy client can live and cooperate (e.g., practice-dating therapy in combination with sexual surrogate therapy), the impact can be very positive and beneficial at a meaningful, gut level. In other words, the client may actually begin to apply the various cassette messages to his life, and particularly to his emotional preparations for and actual interactions with his assigned practice-dates.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For those not familiar with the therapeutic use of audio-cassette programs, this much must be delineated here: (1) The programs are <i class="calibre4"> not</i> listened to during the valuable group meeting time. Each client has his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her own copies of the cassette programs, and he/she listens to them as part of a program of regular homework exercises. Secondly (2), the cassettes are to be listened to <i class="calibre4"> repeatedly, </i> NOT just once or twice. This is the only way the subconscious mind can begin to be affected and appropriately influenced by the messages. For example, a client may be asked to listen to a particular cassette once daily for ten days, and then three times per week for the ensuing thirty weeks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not the purpose of this book to list all of the best material that is currently available. Nevertheless, it has been my experience that the following cassette programs constitute a highly worthwhile investment for any practice-dating therapy program:</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bibliotherapy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Therapists can also require their clients to read certain books. And some of the group meetings that are integral to a practice-dating program can be given over to discussions of the personal meaning and practical</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p565"></a>534 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">applicability of insights contained in these books to the loveshyness problem. Loveshy people often respond well to anything which contains empirical documentation. In general, they tend to spend a good deal more time with books than do the non-shy—although most of the most appropriate books have become available in condensed form on audio-cassettes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, therapists need to be quite sparing and need to exercise considerably care regarding the books and articles they might incorporate into their practice-dating therapy programs. Textbooks and scholarly monographs need to be avoided as clients will seldom cooperate in reading this type of material anyway. In fact, this is one reason why audio-cassette programs will usually make a considerably more prudent investment—particularly since they can be comfortably listened to over and over again. Nevertheless, there have been some short, incisively written books that have proved useful. And these include such items as:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. IN THE MIND's EYE, by Arnold Lazarus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING, by Claude Bristol.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. THINK AND GROW RICH, by Napolean Hill.</p>

<p class="calibre1">5. THE BODY ELECTRIC, by Thelma Moss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. THE ANXIETY DISEASE, by David V. Sheehan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meditation</p>
<p class="calibre1">To an increasing extent practice-dating programs are incorporating an emphasis upon the teaching and practicing of various techniques of meditation. This is done not merely because loveshy people find it very difficult to relax when they are in informal, unstructured social situations. To be sure, the development of an ability to relax <i class="calibre4"> does</i> represent a most desirable "side effect" of competency at meditation. But this is only one of the many benefits to which regular periods of meditation can be expected to lead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In recent years we have learned that regular meditators are far less likely than non-meditators to come down with a host of serious diseases including heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. We have also learned that regular meditators tend to get along with other people considerably more harmoniously than do non-meditators. Virtually all of the evidence indicates that meditators tend to be happier in their personal lives and more productive in everything that they do, than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p566"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 535</p>
<p class="calibre1">non-meditators. And they tend to be substantially more likely than non-meditators to function on a goal-oriented basis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most thought-provoking studies on this subject was recently published by a group of Canadian scientists. It was found, for example, that meditation drastically reduced the recidivism rate among a large group of researched former prisoners. Two groups had been studied; and each of these was composed of criminals of the same types and of the same approximate sentence lengths. One group was accorded systematic training in various techniques of meditation, whereas the other group was given no such training. All members of each of the two groups were accorded regular group therapy throughout each of their respective stays in prison. Similarly, all members of both groups were accorded access to a variety of programs that had been designed to facilitate adjustment in the law-abiding community upon release from prison.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, no program ever attempted by the prison system of British Columbia had ever even come close to the success rate of the meditation program. Meditators were less than one-fifth as likely to recidivate as non-meditators. Thus, after a year-long follow-up the men who had been taught meditation while in prison managed to adjust far more successfully to life in the outside community. (The year-long follow-up commenced from the date of each man's release from prison.) There are many different forms of meditation. In practice-dating therapy we need concern ourselves with only two: (1) meditation for oneness with the God-mind or "universal cosmic intelligence"; and (2) systematic visualizations. There are hundreds of techniques that can be subsumed under the first type. Practice-dating therapists teach six or seven of these and encourage their clients to use whatever one makes them feel the most comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meditation requires some disciplined effort along with a high level of commitment. People need to set aside two 20-minute periods each day, and they must have the dedication to use these for actual meditation. Loveshy people find this more difficult to do than most people.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is why therapists encourage loveshys to get together in a support group with some of their fellow therapy-mates (of either sex) outside of therapy, and meditate together at predesignated times.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Few loveshys actually succeed at reaching the "brilliant white light"</p>
<p class="calibre1">during their first year or so of following a disciplined program of meditation. Nevertheless, real progress is made—and this includes the fact that regular meditation appears to catalyze success at the regular assigned dating exercises. Hence, regular meditation appears to speed up therapy; and this is especially so when it is practiced together with other fellow loveshys.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p567"></a>536 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Systematic visualization</i> is a much easier form of meditation. And it can be engaged in during the regular therapy meetings as well as at almost any other time. A person can do it while walking or (to some extent) even while driving his/her car. It simply involves <i class="calibre4"> "seeing" </i> in the mind's eye what one wishes to come to pass. In addition, it involves <i class="calibre4">feeling</i> and <i class="calibre4"> genuinely believing</i> that what one is visualizing is very much in the actual process of coming to pass. And that nothing can stop this progress towards the attainment of just and honorable goals.1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Systematic visualization can also involve the seeing of a brilliant green or white light penetrating and suffusing (and thus <i class="calibre4"> healing)</i> the physical body of an ill individual. This approach is less applicable to practice-dating, although it has occasionally been used with beneficial results. The visualization of "the light" in this form of meditation is voluntarily directed by the awake ego. In the first form of meditation one <i class="calibre4"> arrives</i> (without any help from the personal ego) at the "brilliant white light" after months and sometimes years of practice and dedicated effort.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One point about meditation that is of considerable importance is that visualized goals tend to take on an especially formidable power (for the good) when the visualization is simultaneously engaged in by several people (friends or therapy-mates) while they are either together in a group context or in their respective places of residence. If the later procedure is used, a specific time should be agreed upon and set aside by all group members. For example, it might be agreed that every night from 10:00 until 10:10 the entire group will stop whatever they are doing and intensely visualize a particular desired outcome for a predesignated group member. Or they might simultaneously visualize the person they are trying to help being suffused by a pale of powerful white light. Of course, the member selected would change from time to time so that each member would get his/her turn on many different occasions. This procedure can be followed even if one of the group members happens to be spending a few nights in another time zone. For example, if a member of a group which regularly meets in San Bruno, California, has to spend a few nights in New York, he/she would do the exercise from 1:00 AM to 1:10 AM—the equivalent of 10:00 PM to 10:10 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Down through history systematic visualization has been practiced with often amazing results by witches and warlocks in their eleven-person covens. Today these methods are being disseminated by sales trainers and by university graduate schools of business administration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are being taught to men in middle-management, often at considerable financial cost to employers. And their successful mastery has been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p568"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts</p>
<p class="calibre1">537</p>
<p class="calibre1">found in many business-related research studies to clearly differentiate between people who "make it big" in their business careers, and those who manage to perform only adequately.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Recently these techniques have been taken over by certain quite successful oncologists (cancer specialists). The work of Dr. O. Carl Simonton and his wife Stephanie, at the Fort Worth Cancer Counseling Center, is rooted in training patients in the dedicated and persistent practicing of these techniques. Dr. David Bresler of the U.C.L.A. Pain Clinic, has also encouraged his patients to use these techniques—and with quite substantial success.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Systematic visualization is simply an issue of "mind over matter".</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a form of psychokinesis ("PK"), sometimes called "telekinesis". All matter including the human body is simply a form of energy that is vibrating at comparatively low rates. The concerted effort of, for example, eleven people all simultaneously focusing on the same goal, appears to do much to cause that goal to come to pass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, hard-nosed academics do not like to become involved in this subject. Many of them fear the ostracism of their colleagues. And others are just plain <i class="calibre4"> "prejudiced" </i> against the thought of entertaining hypotheses pertinent to this and related subjects. A key indication that it is worth looking into, however, can be seen in the fact that so many highly successful business people swear by it. Amidst a group wherein success is measured almost entirely by monetary profit, it seems highly unlikely that systematic visualization would be dealt with at all if it did not have an impressive history of bringing about positive, measurable results.  <i class="calibre4"> Thought is a powerful energy form. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Systematic visualization exercises which can be incorporated into practice-dating therapy include the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) For ten minutes at an agreed upon time each night each of the twelve members of a practice-dating group intensely visualizes in his/her mind's eye a particular fellow member happily and successfully "making it" with a member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This visualization must be strongly felt <i class="calibre4"> and believed</i> as well as seen and heard in the mind's eye and ear. The recipient of the exercise for a particular evening must simultaneously be involved in the visualization as well—on his or her own behalf.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(2) For ten minutes each night each group member sees in his/her mind's eye a powerful pale of red light suffusing the entire body, and especially the brain, of a preselected group member.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Red is the color of energy in occult studies. And loveshy people are often melancholic or highly discouraged people who are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p569"></a>538 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">bogged down in the throes of psychoemotional inertia. Red light is therefore appropriate. After the red light is used for a while, the group may also use a powerful pale of green light to bring peace and freedom from anxiety, and then a powerful pale of white light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(3) Each of the twelve members of a therapy group will be encouraged to systematically visualize on his/her own behalf at several different times each day. Each member will be asked to both see and feel himself/herself to be exactly the person he/she wishes to become—particularly in reference to happy and successful man-woman interaction. Thus, the self-image gradually comes to be reprogrammed. People tend to move towards becoming that which they intensely see, feel, hear, and believe in their mind's eye and ear.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a final point, both regular meditation and systematic visualization must be seen as <i class="calibre4"> therapeutic adjuncts ONLY. </i> It is important to stress this point because loveshys tend to be substantially less competent than most people at any and all forms of meditation. Through the use of the right audio-cassettes and/or books most loveshys can be easily convinced <i class="calibre4"> on an intellectual level</i> of the worth of these approaches. However, these methods work best only when the user has fully incorporated his/</p>
<p class="calibre1">her belief into his/her emotional gut essence. Simply put, the user must arrive at the point at which he fully and intensely believes with all his heart and soul that which he is directing himself to "see" in his mind's eye.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The practice-dating client cannot justifiably be criticized for failing to do these exercises properly. As long as he or she does them <i class="calibre4"> at all</i>—</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is all a therapist can reasonably ask. Accepting ideas and visions on an emotional level as well as on an intellectual level IS NOT a purely voluntary process. If it were purely voluntary, no other therapeutic exercise would be required to accomplish the desired end—not even practice-dating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the various meditational techniques can be considered useful therapeutic adjuncts which can serve to catalyze therapeutic gains. A comprehensive therapeutic program for loveshys will use them. But program leaders will fully realize that such techniques cannot be placed at the nucleus or core of therapeutic emphasis. The indispensable <i class="calibre4"> core</i> of a practice-dating therapy program is the <i class="calibre4"> twice-weekly practice dates</i> which are regularly assigned by the therapeutic staff.  <i class="calibre4"> Nothing</i> can substitute for these. Everything else, especially the meditation exercises, should be considered mere aids which may to a greater or lesser extent operate to catalyze improvements.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p570"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 539</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Why Not Simply Use Commercial Dating Services? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point many readers may be wondering why commercial dating services could not be used as a form of self-administered practice-dating therapy. Today all major metropolitan areas are well supplied with dating services and, in the case of New York, with more traditional marriage bureaus as well. However, the owner-managers of these organizations do not have an easy "row to hoe". They are not to be envied!</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are three major reasons why commercial dating services cannot be counted upon to help in the remedying of male loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These reasons can be classified under the following headings: (1) gender ratio; (2) commercial vested interests; and (3) the psychoemotional handicaps endemic in loveshyness prevent most of its victims from taking proper advantage of dating services even when they do join. A sizable proportion of the clientele of most dating services is <i class="calibre4"> already composed</i> of loveshy men. And as indicated in chapter five, the cooperation of 22 percent of the older loveshys studied for this book together with 12 percent of the younger ones, was obtained through the help of a New York area dating service.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Gender Ratio Problem</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The management of dating services do not like to talk about this issue. And in point of fact the problem of imbalanced gender ratios is not really their fault anyway. Imbalanced gender ratios and the inability to do anything about it (other than develop better and more expensive advertisements) constitutes the <i class="calibre4"> number one</i> reason why so many dating services go bankrupt and fold. It is also the main reason why dating services usually require a man to be at least 21 years of age (and sometimes 24) before they will accept his enrollment. Thus, dating services can be of no help to loveshy high school and undergraduate college and university males because most such people are below the minimum age required for joining.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the age-group of 21 to 25-year olds, there are typically anywhere from <i class="calibre4"> five to twenty times</i> as many male members as there are female members. And this is true even in a society that is often alleged to have many more marriage-oriented women than marriage oriented men! Further, this highly problematical gender-ratio situation is aggravated by the fact that ninety percent or more of loveshy men want their "love-mate" to be at least two or three years <i class="calibre4"> younger</i> than themselves. Indeed, older loveshy men often want their women to be <i class="calibre4"> twenty</i> or more years <i class="calibre4">younger</i> than themselves. And they want women who are both</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p571"></a>540 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">(a) physically attractive with the "long hair and pretty face", and (b) both willing and desirous of "mothering" or "nursing" them out of their loveshyness-based inhibitions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike some contemporary psychologists, I believe that it <i class="calibre4"> is</i> normal and healthy for a man to prefer the "nurturing, maternal type" of woman.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that it is unnecessary as well as undesirable for a therapist to try to dissuade a man from these predilections. Nevertheless, the facts are plain. Whereas there are plenty of attractive, warm, nurturing, motherly women "out there", this type definitely <i class="calibre4"> does not</i> do business with commercial dating services—especially as far as the 18 to 30 age group is concerned. Indeed, such women are "taken up" fast (during their late teens and early twenties) by the non-shy as such women are very much</p>
<p class="calibre1">"in demand"; and the demand far exceeds the supply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most commercial dating services will accept women as young as 18. But very few women this young ever enroll. Even so, most loveshy men even in their 40s want to date attractive, "single-never-married"</p>
<p class="calibre1">women in their late teens and twenties. And many such older men cite as justification for their preference the fact that they would still like to have one or two children, and birth complications are much more likely to accrue to women over 30. Sad though it might be, most loveshy men past the age of 35 will probably never be able to become fathers even if they do eventually manage to obtain a woman. Of course, this may ultimately result in less human suffering if it helps to cause the inhibition and low anxiety threshold genes to die out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imbalanced gender ratios create other serious problems as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And via adverse "word of mouth" advertising among female friendship groups the imbalance is preserved or made even worse because women become motivated against joining. For example, each month the typical dating service sends out the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the recommended "matches". Typically an 18 to 24-year old women will receive between 30 and 50 names for each month during which she remains a member. The typical 21 to 24-year old man will receive <i class="calibre4"> only</i> <i class="calibre4">one or two. </i> Occasionally if he is lucky he may be given three; but never more than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The net result of this is that the home telephones of 18 to 24-year old women ring endlessly. The women and their roommates or families are virtually "driven up the walls" by this situation. And in short order they become irritated, angry and psychologically alienated from the whole business. Often they end up having their names removed from the list, or they advise each male caller that "they are already engaged", or some other "bullshit" lie.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile most of the male members become angry and upset.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They had spent their good money on a dating service; and the one or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p572"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 541</p>
<p class="calibre1">two women whose names they received this month do not even want to meet them. Quite understandably many men become quite angry, and they call the dating service office and accuse the staff of sending them an outdated list. Some of the women assert to their male callers that they had "dropped out" of the dating service six months earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bullshit",  <i class="calibre4"> yes! </i> But sometimes the inexperienced and severely loveshy man is not entirely certain about that. In any case, highly reticent loveshy men are ill-prepared to deal with this sort of situation over the phone. And many of them do not call the women whose names they receive at all. Instead they write letters to the women—most of which go unanswered. And when the letters are answered, they too are likely to say something like "I am going with someone now", or "I am already engaged", or even "I am already married"!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another problem accruing from the gender-ratio imbalance is the surfeit of divorced women who do business with dating service firms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Given their "starry-eyed" romantic attitudes, most loveshy men do not want to date a divorced woman. They figure that if she divorced one man she can just as easily divorce again. Such women are seen by the loveshy as "expecting far too much". But a more important issue, I believe, is the loveshys' very strong need for a nurturing love-mate who will stick by them "through thick and thin", and who will never reject them. Many loveshys view the prospect of remaining single all their lives as less terrible than the thought of marrying and then being victimized by divorce.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, loveshy men want someone who will fall in love with them and give them unconditional acceptance. Loveshy men fear argumentation and friction. They are highly romantic and in need of the sort of young women who would never even have a chance to think about joining a dating service. Again, the type of girl the typical loveshy man wants is quite likely to have already been won by somebody by the time she gets to be 19 or 20.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, for men in the 35 to 44 year age range the gender ratio in most commercial dating firms is about 50:50. And for men who are 45</p>
<p class="calibre1">years of age or older there are actually more women than men in the typical dating service membership. On the other hand, for men in the 25 to 29 year age range there are usually about ten men for every one woman; and in the 30 to 34 year old age range there are about three times as many male members as there are female members. Thus, at least as far as younger age men are concerned we have here another indication that men seem to want and need woman a great deal more than women want or need men. Despite what demographers say about there currently being a shortage of men in the younger, marriage-oriented ages, this is certainly <i class="calibre4"> not</i> reflected in the membership rolls of commercial</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Commercial Vested Interests</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the outset I must say that I have no opposition or hostility to business. Business has often been thoughtlessly maligned by naive pseudo-intellectuals who would not be enjoying one-fourth of their current surfeit of luxuries if it were not for business and the free enterprise system. However, all businesses must show a profit in order to stay afloat. And in the case of dating services, the showing of an adequate financial return is often very difficult indeed. Of course, making their services better, servicing the needs of clients better, and advertising better, all represent viable ways of improving things. Unfortunately, dating services have not as yet been able to figure out how to successfully engineer the attainment of these desirable goals. A dating service proprietor may launch his/her business with a highly conscientious, deeply caring attitude. Yet almost always this attitude will be shot through to shreds by the everyday trials of running the business and keeping it afloat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have interviewed the proprietors of six different dating services located on the east and west coasts. And these proprietors seem to agree that as many as 30 percent (almost one-third) of their male clients are</p>
<p class="calibre1">"pathologically shy" or severely loveshy. Most of these proprietors would like to spend some time personally counseling their loveshy male clients. But none of them are equipped from the standpoint of either education or time to be able to do this. All would like to hire a professional counseling staff. But none has the resources to hire so <i class="calibre4"> much as one</i> university trained clinical psychologist, psychiatric social worker, or counselor. The hard financial realities of managing a business obviate providing any one client with very much time or attention.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Related to this is the problem of <i class="calibre4"> vested interests. </i> Every business and, indeed, all human beings have these. And a person would have to be a veritable "Jesus Christ" not to take these interests into account in the conducting of his/her affairs. In the case of dating service owners, care is taken to keep prospective members "in the dark" about such problems as gender ratio imbalance, shortages of single, never married women, women members prematurely discontinuing their memberships, the difficulty of actually getting a date, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> If dating service owners were frank about these matters, most of them would no longer even</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p574"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 543</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a business! Further, if owners either hired a counseling staff or endeavored to conduct such counseling themselves, they would be taking much needed time away from the mechanics of running their businesses. Moreover, even if they did provide some counseling to the loveshy, the realities of the dating service business make it very unlikely that <i class="calibre4"> real help</i> could be accorded. In essence, the severely loveshy male would be no closer to the attainment of his goal even if his dating service did endeavor to provide him with some counseling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, dating service proprietors seem to be exasperated by the behavior (more accurately the <i class="calibre4"> non-behavior)</i> of the chronic loveshy. The reasons why will become clear in the next section.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Barriers Posed by the LoveShys' Psychoemotional</i> <i class="calibre4">Handicaps</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner or later many of even the most extremely loveshy men sign up with one or more dating services. Some readers may have difficulty understanding this inasmuch as "dates" obtained through such organizations are essentially blind dates—and blind dates should, everything else being equal, prove very anxiety-provoking for the loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The gist of the matter is that dating services provide an excuse for calling a woman. Again, loveshy men, like all people with inborn inhibition, hve a very difficult time handling socially ambiguous situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order for a man to telephone someone whom he sees at work every day (and whom he believes he would like to get to know from a romantic standpoint), necessitates providing an explanation. Immediately upon picking up the receiver the woman will ask "who is this?" and "why are you calling?" The second question (indeed, the very thought of it), arouses great anxiety in loveshy men. What, indeed, can they say? How can they admit that they have a romantic interest in the person? And how can they defend this personal interest?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The dating service bypasses this highly anxiety-provoking step.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The loveshy man merely has to respond: "I received your name and telephone number from the ABC Dating Service, and I guess you received mine as well." I believe it is because the dating service <i class="calibre4"> bypasses</i> this ambiguity-laden and highly anxiety-provoking step that it attracts so many loveshy men. Again, as many as 30 percent of the male clients of dating services are severely loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner or later almost all urban and suburban men who are not hooked into cohesive kinship networks and/or friendship networks will enroll in some sort of dating service. And, of course,  <i class="calibre4"> one</i> reason why women are much less likely than young men to enroll is that a much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p575"></a>544 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher percent of women <i class="calibre4"> are</i> hooked into kinship and friendship networks. Women's friendship groups do not require the competitive success that is normally called for in male friendship groups.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key problem for many loveshy dating service customers is that they do not have the nerve to make the telephone calls. Some of them cope with this problem by introducing themselves <i class="calibre4"> by letter</i> to the women to whom their dating service had assigned them. And occasionally they do succeed in getting a date this way. But more often than not their letter (often a very lengthy one) goes unanswered. Thus, the loveshy man's confession of severe shyness turns most women off. This is especially likely to be the case for any woman who is already inundated with telephone calls from men who are not shy—or at least not too shy to make a telephone call.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A related problem for the loveshy is that most dating services provide their women clients with the option of listing <i class="calibre4"> only</i> their name and telephone number. In essence, the information which the loveshy man receives by mail very often does not include an address. And when the address is missing he obviously cannot mail a letter to the girl. Some dating services permit a woman to give out <i class="calibre4"> only</i> her telephone number; in these cases neither the name or the address is provided to male</p>
<p class="calibre1">"matches". This "social ambiguity" scares the hell out of severely loveshy men; and they are forced to wait for a "match" which includes a name as well as a street address.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Exacerbating the situation is the fact that very few loveshy men keep a telephone in their private apartments. In fact, this is one trait of the loveshy which exasperates most dating service managers. Of course, loveshy men are not always too shy about using their work phone to register complaints about not receiving a street address. Inasmuch as dating service managers and telephone clerks are untrained from the standpoint of understanding loveshyness, they are seldom in a position to be of any help. Their attitude is usually: "If you can't call her, there's nothing we can do." There is nothing in the dating service contract which stipulates that street addresses must be given out. Of course, some loveshys write a letter anyway, and mail it to the dating service for forwarding. Assuming that the dating service does forward these letters, it is fair to say that such forwarded mail is virtually never answered by the women receiving it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dating services cannot and do not provide the special type of coeducational group therapy that invariably accompanies and is integral to practice-dating therapy programs. As such, dating services cannot begin to deal with the sort of loveshyness problems which develop as the so-called "second plateau" of a man-woman relationship is approached by a client. Few loveshy clients ever ask an assigned "match" for a second</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p576"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 545</p>
<p class="calibre1">date; and this is true even when they like her. Loveshy men tend to be extremely awkward at the end of a date. They do not know how to smoothly conclude it, or how to deal with the expectation that they ought to kiss the girl. Most loveshy men have never kissed a woman in their lives. On rare occasion a loveshy man will succeed in getting three or four dates in a row from the same girl. But his severe inhibition and inability to "be himself"—to cope with the ambiguity of what to talk about once all the superficialities have been covered—is enough to keep him from either telephoning or even writing the girl for additional meetings. Again, this tends to be true even when he very much likes the girl and would attempt to continue seeing her if he had the sense of personal freedom to be able to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an interesting paradox here that was commented upon by two of the dating service owners I interviewed. Loveshy men are often <i class="calibre4">extremely</i> talkative when they are on a first date with someone whom they think they like. Indeed, they are sometimes talkative to the extent of appearing to dominate the interaction. However, their "conversation"</p>
<p class="calibre1">might more aptly be described as "lecturing"; the woman usually ends up saying very little. Often times the woman may at first enjoy the fact that she is dating a very talkative and seemingly intelligent man. She may even have trouble "seeing" him as shy because of the way he always seems to have a never-ending series of things to say, and because of the way he <i class="calibre4"> appears</i> to dominate the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But by the time the fourth date has concluded he is likely to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">"scared shitless" about contacting the same woman for an additional meeting. This severe diffidence is obviously not due to any unwillingness or disinclination towards making a permanent commitment. A permanent commitment is what loveshy men want more than anything else. The problem is that they are emotionally incapable of dealing with the "second plateau". And the dating service staff are business entrepreneurs; they have no way of helping the shys over this most disconcerting "hump". (Of course, it would doubtless eventually become <i class="calibre4"> very</i> <i class="calibre4">good for business</i> if these entrepreneurs did endeavor to figure out an effective way to help!)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A Corroborating Study</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now surprisingly few research studies have been conducted on commercial dating firms. However, what little work has been done tends to support the conclusions which I have delineated in this chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably the best study heretofore to become available was published in 1972, by K. M. Wallace. Wallace both established and maintained an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p577"></a>546 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduction service for research purposes only. He kept his club going for ten years and over that period of time attracted some 6,033 members.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wallace was able to compare and contrast his membership with the general population on several important dimensions. To be specific, he found quite significant differences between his club members and a comparison group of nonmembers on the <i class="calibre4"> sociability</i> and <i class="calibre4"> inhibition</i> factors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The club members were more likely to be quiet, nonaggressive, and shy, and therefore unable to compete effectively in the dating and mating game of our society. On the other hand, Wallace also found that his club members were better educated than the analogous group of nonmembers that had been drawn from the general population. Not surprisingly, his club had attracted many more male members than female members. And indeed, the sociability, shyness and education differences between the club members and the comparison group of nonmembers were much greater for the males than for the females.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Attractiveness and Education</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It came as somewhat of a surprise to me that most of the loveshy men with dating service experience had <i class="calibre4"> not</i> been displeased with the physical attractiveness level of the "matches" to whom they had been assigned. While there are obviously many formidable barriers which operate to impede dating services from helping severely loveshy men, it is heartening to learn that a dearth of feminine pulchritude does not appear to be one of these barriers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, all of the dating service proprietors with whom I spoke agreed that their male clients had well above average educations. In addition, the education level completed by the typical loveshy male client appears to be even higher than that which had been completed by the average male client who is not conspicuously loveshy. Similarly, all of these proprietors agreed with my own conclusion that loveshy men tend to be underachievers (status inconsistents) when it comes to annual income and job prestige level. Thus, in contrast to the majority of male dating service clients, loveshy clients typically have income and job prestige levels that are substantially inferior to their own levels of completed education.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All in all these data suggest that women are not likely to be particularly impressed by a man's academic degrees or by his advanced academic and intellectual attainments. (In fact, there is evidence that the wives of highly educated husbands tend to have poorer self-images than the wives of men with more moderate educations.) Younger loveshy readers, in particular, need to pay heed to this point. A major</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p578"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 547</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivation among loveshy men for obtaining an advanced education is that women will be favorably impressed. The hard, cold reality of the matter is that women tend to feel most at home with men who are relaxed and natural, with a good sense of humor, and who can communicate on a spontaneous <i class="calibre4"> "feeling" </i> level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men are commonly perceived by their dating service</p>
<p class="calibre1">"matches" as being quite tense and nervous. They are also seen as being too serious, and as "all head and no heart". Thus, the years of academic study put in by many loveshy men may well serve to aggravate these women-alienating tendencies by developing a trained incapacity for spontaneous, natural, humorous, relaxed socializing. Inasmuch as loveshy men experience virtually no social life at all at the universities they attend, their behavioral and thought tendencies tend to become geared almost exclusively towards the serious, towards that which is very "deep"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and abstract, and towards personal problem areas, most of which they are too shy to discuss.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps some loveshys pursue an extensive amount of higher education as a way of finding some sense of personal identity and of securing a range of personal self-satisfactions which most people secure through informal social interaction with friends and family. Most people establish a firm sense of personal identity through informal friendly interaction. Those who lack informal friendships may seek their sense of personal self-worth through achievements in higher education.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The American system of education is in many ways destructively one-sided and ridiculously imbalanced in its emphasis. It develops man's intellect yet totally ignores the fact that psychoemotional and spiritual growth are also needed for internal harmony and for the ability to compete <i class="calibre4"> and to USE</i> attained intellectual awareness in the service of both self and society. Thus, people absolutely require a certain level of social self-confidence and of interpersonal finesse. It has often been said that highly educated people lack ordinary "horse sense". I think that what they <i class="calibre4"> really</i> lack is <i class="calibre4"> psychoemotional integration. </i> Practice-dating therapy can do much to remedy this lack of psychoemotional integration in a substantial proportion of poorly balanced male students— <i class="calibre4">namely the loveshy. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving the matter of remedying these deficits to commercial dating services is obviously not going to work. As per the material reviewed in this and the preceding chapter, practice-dating therapy quite clearly appears to be the best and only truly sensible remedy for severe loveshyness. The time has arrived for taking action geared toward developing viable practice-dating programs throughout the United States, and making these available to people of all ages who are in need.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Self-image Psychology as a Therapeutic Adjunct</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This book has stressed the <i class="calibre4"> biological</i> basis of loveshyness. And most contemporary writers continue to assume that self-image psychology is incompatible with a biologically based point of view. But rather than being mutually exclusive, I believe that these two positions complement each other and provide for a better balanced and more accurate understanding of loveshyness than could be arrived at from adherence to either position alone. The purpose of this section is to delineate the key principles of self-image psychology, and to show how they effectively complement the biological viewpoint that I have so strongly stressed throughout this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maxwell Maltz, one of the great leaders of contemporary psychology, has labeled the self-image <i class="calibre4"> "psychology's single most important</i> <i class="calibre4">discovery this century". </i> Of course, the self-image has always been with us. But it has taken until comparatively recently for modern man to become mindful of its enormous importance for shaping and determining the quality of all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Key Principles</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us imagine two levels of thinking: the <i class="calibre4"> judge</i> and the <i class="calibre4"> robot. </i> The</p>
<p class="calibre1">"judge" represents the <i class="calibre4"> conscious</i> level of the mind. It is responsible for collecting information from the environment, putting it into the mind's memory bank, and making rational decisions. In contrast, the "robot"</p>
<p class="calibre1">represents the <i class="calibre4"> subconscious</i> level of thinking. And among its major responsibilities are (1) the storage of information in the so-called <i class="calibre4"> memory</i> <i class="calibre4">bank</i> of the mind, and (2) goal-seeking. Indeed, in certain highly significant respects the subconscious mind <i class="calibre4"> is</i> the memory bank, and it operates very much like a computer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, like a computer the subconscious mind or "robot"  <i class="calibre4"> cannot tell</i> <i class="calibre4">the difference between what is right or wrong, good or bad, false or true information. </i> Like a computer it is fundamentally <i class="calibre4"> without any intelligence</i> of its own. Like a computer it cannot think for itself. It must depend totally upon what is programmed into it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The information storage and goal-seeking functions of the subconscious mind can be compared to a robot auto-pilot. And as we know, auto-pilots are devices which can be programmed to seek a target. The torpedo and the ballistic missile are good examples of this. Both are guided by highly sophisticated electronic systems that seek a target unerringly through the use of feedback. The human brain and mind operate in very much the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p580"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 549</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the <i class="calibre4"> judge</i> part of the human mind cannot make a decision without first clearing that decision with the <i class="calibre4"> robot. </i> The "robot" checks its memory bank (which contains all the true <i class="calibre4"> and false</i> information that up to that time had been programmed into it), and it then relays that information back to the "judge" for action. Of course, it would logically seem natural that a person's "judge" would control his "robot" in a kind of master-slave relationship. But unfortunately,  <i class="calibre4"> JUST THE REVERSE IS</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">TRUE! The subconscious "robot" controls the conscious "judge" level of thinking! </i> Action frequently takes place without consultation with the "judge".</p>
<p class="calibre1">But no action can ever take place without reference to the computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">"robot" (including all the substantive content of the <i class="calibre4"> memory</i> of that computer).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every moment of every day we program our "robot" self-image to work either for us or against us. Since like a computer it is only a mechanism having no "judging" function, it strives to meet the objectives and goals that we set before it, whether positive or negative, true or false, right or wrong. Its most basic function is to follow instructions based upon previous inputs, just like a computer reading its tape and responding automatically.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contemporary behavioral scientists are pretty much in agreement that a person's "robot" subconscious is not capable of distinguishing between actual experience and that which is vividly imagined as a result of strongly felt fears and anxieties. Thus, a person's subconscious "robot computer" stores emotional fantasies as though they were his/her own reality. Many of a person's everyday decisions and behaviors are based upon information that has been stored in the subconscious "robot computer" as truth. Much of this information is merely a figment of a person's imagination that is shaded and colored by his or her current environment. In sum, to a greater or lesser extent <i class="calibre4"> we are all slaves to our</i> <i class="calibre4">subconscious computer robots. </i> And according to this viewpoint, few people have more fully and totally succumbed to this slavery than the chronically and intractably loveshy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the especially noteworthy properties of self-image psychology is that it underscores the enormous power and flexibility of the human mind. As a case in point, there are certain Pacific Ocean societies wherein at certain times during the year <i class="calibre4"> everyone</i> walks barefoot across approximately fifty feet of red hot coals. These coals hover between 800</p>
<p class="calibre1">and 1,200 degrees Farenheit on ceremonial occasions. And yet tribesmen ranging from very young children to the elderly walk barefoot across the hot coals without (1) experiencing any pain whatsoever, and (2) without any tissue damage of any sort accruing to the heels or soles of the feet.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p581"></a>550 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "fire walkers" have been extensively studied by anthropologists, journalists, media people, physical scientists, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> And there can be no question about the fact that these people actually do go through their ceremony without experiencing any pain or tissue damage. How is this accomplished? How could such a phenomenon be "humanly possible"? The answer seems to be that everyone in these "fire walker"</p>
<p class="calibre1">societies is presented with a consistent set of messages virtually from the time of birth. Children of these societies are never presented with any contradictory set of messages. In essence, there is never <i class="calibre4"> any</i> reason for <i class="calibre4"> any</i> of these people to doubt their capacity to walk barefoot over the hot coals during the designated ceremonial occasions. These peoples had always been conditioned <i class="calibre4"> ("programmed" </i>, if you prefer) to believe that the Gods would uphold them from any pain or harm as long as they followed certain long-standing customs according to tradition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the self-image psychologist <i class="calibre4"> socialization is programming; </i> and it is also a highly potent form of <i class="calibre4"> hypnosis, </i> especially when the messages programmed are clear and consistent—in essence, when each elder or teacher programs (hypnotizes) the <i class="calibre4"> same</i> message. Quite similar to Spiritualists, many self-image psychologists believe that each and every human being contains an element of God. They believe that if the individual is programmed (hypnotized) into trusting the God within, the accomplishments that can be effected stagger the imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, some amazing things have been accomplished in our own society using plain, ordinary hypnosis. For example, any person who is amenable to deep hypnosis can be rendered fully refractory to pain as well as to tissue damage. Some people are capable of hypnotizing themselves in the dentist's chair, and of not feeling any pain at all—</p>
<p class="calibre1">even though the dentist had administered no anesthetic. Others can program themselves into having an out-of-the-body experience while the dentist is working, and thus avoid pain in that way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A person can be placed into a very deep trance <i class="calibre4"> (if</i> he is amenable), and he can be told that an ice cube is going to be placed into the palm of his left hand—when in fact a red hot half-dollar piece is placed into the palm of his hand. Upon receiving the red hot half-dollar (after it had been taken from atop a red hot grill on a stove), the person will characteristically enfold his fingers around it as though it were a real ice cube.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After such an experiment has been completed it is observed that no tissue damage of any kind had been done to the person's hand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrariwise, if the hypnotized person is handed an ice cube and told that he is receiving a red hot half-dollar piece,  <i class="calibre4"> then real pain</i> plus a severe burn blister will immediately happen.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p582"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 551</p>
<p class="calibre1">Celebrated psychic Jack Schwartz is able to force a long dagger right through his arm, and then remove it, without causing himself any pain or tissue damage of any kind. Indeed, he does this all the time at his shows in Europe. And, of course, Watergate conspirator Gordon Liddy developed some notoriety for his ability to hold his hand over an open flame—without experiencing any pain or suffering tissue damage.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds of other fascinating examples could be cited. The message of all of this material is that <i class="calibre4"> under propitious circumstances</i> the body can be made the servant of the mind. The body is nothing more than a very dense form of energy which can be,  <i class="calibre4"> under the right circumstances,</i> shielded from harm by the much higher form of energy represented by the mind. For example, in the case of the "fire walkers" the bioplasmic body (which suffuses the physical body) creates a temporary shield on the heels and soles of the feet which serves to obviate both pain and tissue damage—temporarily, as per the serenely held belief system of the person. The same thing happens to the palm of the hand of the hypnotized person who receives the red hot half-dollar piece.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spiritualists delight in citing certain of Christ's statements which can be found in the Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John sections of the New Testament; e.g., "According to your faith, so be it unto you"; "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he"; "All things are possible to him that believ-eth"; and "Greater things than these shall ye do". Thus, a serene but deeply held conviction that what one envisions will come to pass, will almost always cause it to indeed happen. The problem for severely loveshy men is that they find it very difficult to be serene and comfortable about their beliefs and convictions. They can accept all of this material on an intellectual level, but they are incapable of dealing with it on a gut-emotional level— <i class="calibre4">where it counts. </i> And as any hypnotist will agree, severely loveshy people are among the most non-hypnotizable parts of the human population. They are simply too tense to simply "let go and let God".</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Blending Self-image Psychology with the Biological</i> <i class="calibre4">Perspective</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Self-image psychologists strongly stress the idea that WE <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> what goes into the robot computer of our subconscious minds. In essence, <i class="calibre4">WE</i> choose to do the original programming. We choose to permit the governing and goal-seeking information to get into our subconscious minds in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As author of this book it is my position that this is <i class="calibre4"> only partly true. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Much of the most potent and influential programming of our "robot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p583"></a>552 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">subconscious computers" goes on while we are still very young and impressionable. Thus, a young child is in no position <i class="calibre4"> to personally choose</i> the information about himself and his environment which will manage to get recorded on the "computer tape" of his subconscious "robot computer" mind. His parents, significant adults, and childhood bullies are the ones who do this sort of choosing, never the small child himself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Small children are quite emotionally dependent (and this is rooted in biological dependency) upon parents, and this sort of near-total emotional dependency is a prerequisite for the most thoroughgoing socialization. Thus, emotional dependency constitutes the optimal set of circumstances for the programming of minds ( <i class="calibre4">deep hypnosis)</i> which is what the <i class="calibre4"> socialization</i> process is all about. Young children are maximally suggestible; and this suggestibility provides the most perfect fertilizer for the hypnotizing and programming of minds and of mental sets (which can swiftly become quite intractably rigid.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the messages of parents and of childhood bullies are consistent, they will inevitably cause the programming and hypnotizing of impressionable minds, no matter how ridiculously false these messages might be. In essence, the socially inhibited child (with genetically rooted inhibition and low anxiety threshold) often receives a one-sided set of self-labels. And without his even being aware of it, these self-labels are easily programmed into the robot computer tape of his subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secondly, the social stimulus value of a young boy has a very strong influence upon the nature and tenor of the messages that are likely to be fed to him over time. It is certain that boys who because of inborn inhibition and low anxiety threshold do not like "rough and tumble"</p>
<p class="calibre1">play are likely to be accorded a steady stream of stingingly disparaging messages about themselves. And many of these are bound to get programmed into the subconscious (computer tape) mind. An adult can use his rational intellect to censor out mostly all disparaging messages.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An impressionable child is unfortunatly not in a position to be able to do this. In addition, there is likely to be a consistency in the messages an impressionable child receives which far surpasses any consistency in the messages an adult receives from different people in his or her life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Theoretically it is perfectly possible for a male with high inborn inhibition and low native anxiety threshold to develop a fully healthy self-image— <i class="calibre4">and</i> to be totally <i class="calibre4"> un</i> afflicted with shyness. Unfortunately, within the context of contemporary American society it is extremely unlikely that such an eventuality could come to pass. A <i class="calibre4"> girl</i> with such inborn elastic limitations might well develop a strongly self-confident disposition. And a boy born among the Zuni or Hopi Indian tribes might</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p584"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 553</p>
<p class="calibre1">similarly do so. But a <i class="calibre4"> boy</i> born within the mainstream of American society is highly unlikely to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Native, inborn attributes all have their social stimulus values. And these social stimulus values interact with the pre-existing biases of people; and they thus call forth social reactions—including disparaging or positive labeling. These labels create strong <i class="calibre4"> visualizations</i> which get indelibly programmed into the robot computer of the subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus what starts out as an <i class="calibre4"> elastic</i> inborn limit swiftly becomes crystallized and "etched in cement".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, of equal importance in explaining the rigid, intractable behavior (or non-behavior) of the loveshy is the low native anxiety threshold itself. Moralists and self-image psychologists commonly insist that a loveshy person "could take the bull by the horns"  <i class="calibre4"> if he wanted to,</i> and as a rational adult discard all the trash (false beliefs) from the computer tape of his subconscious mind. Thus, he "could" engage in a rational <i class="calibre4"> house cleaning</i> operation. Given that the loveshy person "could"</p>
<p class="calibre1">do this, why doesn't he?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem is that the emotional part of man's mind is far stronger than the rational, intellectual part. And this is a fact that has long been supported by physiological psychologists. The emotions serve as the <i class="calibre4">cement</i> which keep both false and true ideas intractably welded to the computer tape of the subconscious mind. Further, the emotional bond between a young child and his parents (the precondition of emotional dependency), not only facilitates socialization, but it also causes all of the values and ideas (both false and true) which parents impart to become <i class="calibre4">indelibly imprinted</i> in the child's computer memory bank (subconscious mind). Thus, the emotions serve as a kind of <i class="calibre4"> cement</i> which effectively keep certain ideas in an individual's mind for life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately, those with very low native anxiety thresholds have far more of this <i class="calibre4"> cement glue</i> than do those with the advantage of higher native anxiety thresholds. From a purely intellectual standpoint (the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"rational judge" part of the mind), the loveshy man is as capable as anybody else of separating what is true from what is false. He is also just as capable as anyone of determining which ideas need to be discarded from the computer tape that is stored in his subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a poignant illustration of how powerful this "cement" can get, more than one loveshy man told me that he feared the experiencing of anxiety worse than he feared death itself. Many of the loveshys described anxiety feelings as being of the most overwhelmingly excruciating nature—as something which must be avoided even more scrupulously than death itself. Moralists, rational-emotive psychologists, and self-image psychologists, often see anxiety as something which is quite</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p585"></a>554 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">ephemoral. But to those with low native anxiety thresholds, anxiety is as overwhelmingly and stingingly real as anything of a tangible nature ever could be.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as inborn attributes all have their good or bad social stimulus value and call forth social reactions that are in conformance with those values, a person's inborn anxiety threshold <i class="calibre4"> itself</i> places a highly effective albeit elastic limit upon any rational housecleaning he might consciously (intellectually) want to do of the content of the robot computer of his subconscious mind. If the false information (together with all the "cement"</p>
<p class="calibre1">represented by the very low native anxiety threshold) could be removed from the subconscious computer tape, the loveshy person's problems would clearly be solved. Unfortunately, this "housecleaning" appears to be feasible only for shys with reasonably high native anxiety thresholds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, a person's general level of self-esteem is always a byproduct of how closely the following two factors agree:</p>
<p class="calibre1">(1) the person's behaviors and behavioral omissions; (2) how the person thinks <i class="calibre4"> and feels</i> deep down in his "gut" about his behaviors and behavioral omissions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When these two factors are in reasonable harmony the person will have a healthy level of self-esteem. To the extent that there are marked discrepancies between these two factors, then to that extent the person will be bogged down by an unsatisfactory general level of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Among loveshy men the discrepancies between these two factors are very formidable indeed. And these discrepancies are in large measure responsible for the crystallization of what might otherwise have remained the <i class="calibre4"> elastic limits</i> of inhibition and low anxiety threshold. Thus, inborn limits which had started out flexible lose their flexibility; and they become reified into the behavioral manifestations of intractable, lifelong loveshyness. The steady stream of grossly disparaging labeling from parents, peers and teachers has a great deal to do with the ultimate reification (hardening) of these elastic limits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, in recent years self-image psychology has had a great deal to say about the problem of shyness and about how to remedy it. Many of the ideas eminating from this perspective are quite sound. And they deserve serious consideration by anyone interested in the loveshyness problem. But there are some pitfalls in this perspective as well, four of which are of especial importance: (1) self-image psychologists operate under the assumption that practically everything is learned; they ignore research evidence which pertains to inborn, biologically based human differences, particularly as these relate to personality. Second (2), they often assume that a person is responsible for everything that gets into his/her "robot computer" subconscious mind. Thirdly (3), self-image</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p586"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 555</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychologists typically <i class="calibre4"> quite wrongly</i> assume that the content of the subconscious robot computer mind is amenable to the workings of the rational intellect. And fourthly (4), self-image psychology enthusiasts tend to be ultra-rightist social-political thinkers. Blindly and with child-like innocence they enthusiastically give assent to the creed: "If it is to be it is up to me!"</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Self-image Therapy</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Therapy based upon self-image psychology involves the systematic teaching of two key activities: (1) visualization, and (2) affirmation-making. At the outset I must stress that what I am about to recommend should never be applied to the loveshy <i class="calibre4"> by itself</i> as the exclusive mode of therapy. When used along with nothing else, visualization and affirmation-making invariably fail to help the severely loveshy. On the other hand, when these techniques are <i class="calibre4"> combined</i> into a comprehensive practice-dating therapy package, they will most probably work to facilitate therapeutic progress.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Affirmation-Making and Self-Talk</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">We all talk to ourselves almost endlessly each and every moment of each and every day. In fact, it is very difficult not to talk to ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is one reason why meditation is so difficult for most adults to learn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meditation is difficult because it requires stilling and quieting the conscious mind to the point where self-talk stops. It requires bypassing the personal ego to the point where the subconscious mind can be reached.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All words contain both a denotation as well as a connotation. In addition, words almost invariably conjure up images <i class="calibre4"> along with emotional</i> <i class="calibre4">feelings. </i> Reality is in very large measure subjective and socially constructed. Each one of us constructs his/her own reality by and through his/her regular patterns of self-talk and affective visualizations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">More importantly, there is a remarkably powerful telekinetic power to the mind and to the thought (energy) patterns which it broadcasts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought tends to create form, and we tend to become that which we think about most of the time. A key common denominator universally present among the pathologically loveshy is <i class="calibre4"> negative self-talk. </i> To be sure, the loveshy did not originate the various negative, self-disparaging messages they continually give themselves. Such negative ideas originated from people outside the self. Nevertheless, these negative ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p587"></a>556 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">and thought patterns constantly create negative self-talk. As the loveshy do not have friends to <i class="calibre4"> distract</i> negative thinking patterns, the negative self-talk tends to be much more constantly ongoing for the loveshy than it is for other types of so-called "negative thinkers".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hence, an important component of therapy for the loveshy is a <i class="calibre4">reversal</i> of these negative self-talk tendencies. Again, this is <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> as central a component of therapy as the practice-dating exercises. Indeed, practice-dating can accomplish a very great deal just from the standpoint of <i class="calibre4"> distracting</i> a loveshy man from his negative thinking habits. With practice-dating he will not have so much time on his hands!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, if we do indeed tend to become what we think about, it is clear that negative self-talk must be replaced by positive self-talk.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"Faith" </i> is a double-edged sword that can benefit or severely hurt a person. If Christ's statement "according to your faith, so be it unto you"</p>
<p class="calibre1">is true, then the loveshy must be conditioned to replace negative faith with positive faith. Rare indeed is the loveshy person who can accomplish this sort of goal on his own. This is why support groups are so important. This is why I have stressed the desirability of developing Shys Anonymous groups, practice-dating therapy groups, coed scouting groups, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> In order to muster the necessary self-discipline and ego strength for accomplishing necessary exercises, a loveshy person needs to be enmeshed in meaningful social support/friendship groups (coeducational in nature) which he sees and interacts with regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The first step in mastering positive self-talk is that of learning and using positive self-affirmations. The most enormously successful business people have been intensively studied by empirical researchers. And one of the things which better than 90 percent of them have in common is the frequent use of positive self-affirmation and positive self-talk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Affirmations need not be objectively correct, and they must <i class="calibre4"> always</i> be stated in the <i class="calibre4"> present tense. </i> There is no time or space at the higher vibrational levels of energy. The following statements illustrate positive self-affirmations which self-image therapists might prescribe for the severely loveshy:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. I am already very successful with women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Attractive women compete for my companionship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. I am a happy-go-lucky person with a genuine and much appreciated sense of humor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. I am deeply and sincerely loved by a woman who matters greatly to me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5. Women respond in a positive, friendly manner to all of my friendly overtures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">6. Women enjoy being in my company.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p588"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 557</p>
<p class="calibre1">7. I am an excellent conversationalist with women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">8. I am always able to assert myself in a friendly, courteous way whenever I am around women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">9. I am always relaxed and completely able to enjoy myself whenever I am in the company of women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each word of statements such as the foregoing contains an <i class="calibre4"> affective</i> element. This is commonly referred to as the <i class="calibre4"> connotation. </i> And with each repetition of a statement, the feeling tone of that statement gradually reprograms the self-image. All of this takes time to happen. The loveshy need to be facilitated in their efforts to do the homework assignments. They need to be helped towards the development of ego strength/</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-discipline. Audio-cassette programs of the sort I recommended earlier can be of considerable help as far as the positive affirmations are concerned. But above all the loveshy require good therapists and a network of meaningful friends (support groups).</p>
<p class="calibre1">For loveshy clients who are familiar with the positive mind science movement and who have already made some progress towards meditating regularly, some affirmations can be prefaced and concluded with the following standard words and phrases which I have italicized below.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This approach is best pursued immediately upon concluding one's period of meditation:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"Through the power of the universal God-mind within me, I affirm that</i> I am already popular and well-liked by women.  <i class="calibre4"> And for this realization</i> <i class="calibre4">I give thanks. And so it is." </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It is further important that the loveshy be conditioned to stop their thought processes in their tracks whenever they catch themselves engaged in negative self-talk. Self-talk, whether it is positive or negative, operates to program the robot computer of the (subconscious mind) self-image.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, the self-image is the mechanism laden in the subconscious memory bank which governs all aspects of our lives. When the self-image is positive it leads to positive outcomes. When the self-image is negative, failure inevitably dominates the person's life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because it is quite difficult for loveshy men to get into the habit of controlling their thoughts in a positive direction, cassette programs have been devised which can be repeatedly played during a person's free moments. It is just when a person is relatively free of responsibility and in a state of reverie that self-talk normally wields its deepest impact upon the shaping of the subconscious robot self-image. In self-image therapy the shy client is asked to keep a positive self-talk cassette playing during as many such times as possible, especially during the first several months of therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p589"></a>558 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">For readers who are interested, the best such cassette program is titled WINNING FROM WITHIN: THE COMPLETE AUDIOCASSETTE</p>
<p class="calibre1">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WINNING SELF-TALK, by Shad Helmstetter. It can be obtained through the Nightengale-Conant Corporation, at 7300</p>
<p class="calibre1">North Lehigh Avenue, Chicago, IL 60648. Three highly recommended six-cassette programs of a more <i class="calibre4"> instructional</i> nature are THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WINNING, by Denis Waitley, THE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY</p>
<p class="calibre1">OF ACHIEVEMENT, by Steven DeVore, and THE PSYCHOLOGY OF</p>
<p class="calibre1">ACHIEVEMENT, by Brian Tracy. (See the bibliography at the end of this book for more information.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Visualization</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing things in one's mind's eye is the second major component of self-image psychotherapy. In visualization the loveshy client is asked to engage in mental rehearsals of informal social interactions with women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the loveshy client will "see" himself actively engaged in a pleasant conversation with an attractive women. He both <i class="calibre4"> sees</i> and <i class="calibre4"> feels</i> himself to be relaxed and comfortable during the encounter. And he sees himself handling the situation successfully and in a way that is perceived by the women involved as winningly charming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are many biases in the scientific community against the idea of visualization having any real effect for the good. However, the research data which have heretofore become available overwhelmingly support the efficacy of its use. For example, a study was conducted on a large number of high school boys of relatively equal athletic ability. The boys were sorted into three separate groups; and all three groups contained boys of essentially the same characteristics and abilities. As a case in point, the members of each of the three groups were able to throw basketball free throws with an accuracy rate of 23 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boys in the first group were asked to go to the gymnasium every morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, and do nothing but practice basketball free throws. They spent an hour at this every morning for a month, after which time they were tested. And their accuracy rate had shot up to 46 percent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The boys in the second group were advised not to go near the gym. Instead they were told to go to a special room every afternoon between 2 and 3 o'clock, and to spend that hour (each school day for an entire month) doing nothing but visualizing themselves throwing basketball free throws, and "making" each one with 100 percent accuracy. At the end of the month this group was similarly tested. And their accuracy rate had shot up to 44 percent—almost as high as the accuracy rate of the boys who had actually been practicing basketball free throws for the month.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p590"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 559</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was a third group which managed to achieve even more remarkable results. The boys in the third group engaged in <i class="calibre4"> both</i> types of practice activity. They practiced actually throwing free throws each morning between 10 and 11. And then in the afternoon they also spent the period between 2 and 3 o'clock visualizing themselves throwing free throws and "making" each and every one they threw. At the end of the month this third group tested out at 66 percent accuracy at throwing basketball free throws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, active participation in a regular set of programmed visualizations (in which the person actually "sees" himself and "feels"</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself actually involved in the successful pursuit of an activity) can work wonders towards the end of bringing a loveshy man up to an average to above average level of social effectiveness. When such visualizations are regularly practiced along with active real-life social participation <i class="calibre4"> (as in practice-dating therapy), </i> the beneficial effects are commonly multiplied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today visualization exercises are regularly practiced by virtually all major sports and entertainment stars. Readers who have any doubts about the validity of this assertion need only check it out. For example, golf professionals will often spend several hours before an important event just standing in their living rooms with their eyes closed, and visualizing their successful completion of the moves they expect to execute and which they expect to win. In their mind's eye and ear they can both see and hear the crowds with all the relevant smells, atmosphere, environmental ambiance, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> They both see and feel the entire experience before it actually occurs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tennis and basketball stars have similarly discussed their successful utilization of these methods. Professional piano players and trumpet players have used them with formidable success. Successful sales people and other business professionals similarly use them all the time. And lately a burgeoning number of therapists have integrated visualization exercises into their therapeutic programs with great success. Interested readers are well advised to ponder the contents of a book titled IN THE</p>
<p class="calibre1">MIND's EYE, by Dr. Arnold Lazarus. Lazarus is an eminent clinician who has employed these techniques on his patients with a very noteworthy degree of success. In fact, similar techniques are now being used for the treatment of disorders of the physical body. (See especially Dr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">O. Carl Simonton's book GETTING WELL AGAIN, and THE MIRACLE</p>
<p class="calibre1">OF METAPHYSICAL HEALING, by Evelyn Monahan.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">These visualizations must be felt and believed by the person on a deep down gut level. Visualization works best when it is accompanied by the positive self-talk and positive affirmation exercises which I have already discussed. As is true with a great many other things in life, these exercises are a great deal easier to discuss than to actually practice. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p591"></a>560</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercises themselves are certainly not difficult to do. The problem for the severely loveshy is simply that of a deep down cynical attitude of fatalism that "the whole thing is just a bloody waste of time." This attitude of negative expectancy is a logical outgrowth of many, many years of inner pain, suffering and social deprivation. These deep down cynical attitudes render it difficult for a person to force himself to sit down and take the necessary time to do the exercises. Typically, the loveshy man has been so programmed that "deep down" he feels and inwardly "knows" that it "just ain't gonna work".</p>
<p class="calibre1">These feelings which appear to be almost universally endemic among older loveshy men can be successfully reversed only through active involvement in some sort of social support network. This is a key reason why practice-dating therapy groups are so indispensable to the successful treatment of the loveshy. Many contemporary psychotherapists view the insights of self-image psychology as "tremendously good news".</p>
<p class="calibre1">But what good is "good news" if a client lacks the catalysts necessary for him/her to make proper use of it?! Again, these catalysts are the social support groups and, in particular, active involvement in practice-dating therapy. Without these catalysts, self-image psychology becomes nothing more to the loveshy than a bunch of interesting intellectual insights.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The self-fulfilling prophecy has a strong bearing upon self-image psychology.  <i class="calibre4"> When we come to define AND VISUALIZE IN OUR MIND's</i> <i class="calibre4">EYE certain things or ideas as real, those things or ideas tend to become real in</i> <i class="calibre4">their consequences. </i> What we "see" in our mind's eye is what we get.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we come to accept a label that has been consistently placed upon us, we begin to clearly visualize ourselves as fitting that label, regardless of whether it is a good or a bad label. This visualization is basically tantamount to programming the "stupid robot computer" of our subconscious minds—the robot computer which contains all the memory bank and whose substantive content totally governs how we function in the "driver's seat" of our lives. To repeat, our robot computer subconscious minds are gradually programmed by us each and every minute of every day by the content and strength of the <i class="calibre4"> visualizations</i> and <i class="calibre4">self-talk</i> we have, and by the belief we maintain in the veracity of those visualizations and self-talk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The "driver's seat" concept makes a good metaphor. The way people can and will "drive" or govern their lives is entirely a function of the substantive content of the computer tape of their robot subconsciouses. Throughout their formative years loveshy males are typically labeled "shy", "unpopular", "incompetent", "withdrawn", "chicken</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p592"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 561</p>
<p class="calibre1">shit", "uncooperative", "inhibited", "unsociable", <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> Each of these words incorporates an image or mental picture. And this picture is permitted upon its every thought to become indelibly imprinted upon the computer tape of the subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Some Rejoinders for Traditional Psychotherapists</b> There are certain criticisms that come up in response to any discussion of practice-dating therapy. In fact, these same criticisms are typically voiced in regard to <i class="calibre4"> any</i> behavior-oriented style of psychotherapy. And I believe that each is deserving of some attention in this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Symptom Displacement/Symptom Need Argument</i> There are many psychotherapists practicing in America today who continue to seriously believe that neurotic people <i class="calibre4"> need</i> their symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fear, of course, is that if a symptom is "taken away" from a person, he/she will develop a new and perhaps even worse symptom than the one he/she had had originally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The symptom displacement hypothesis has been extensively studied both by behavior therapists as well as by hypnotherapists. And no support of any kind has ever been found for it. Indeed, seldom does more than one patient out of every two hundred develop a new symptom after the old one has been taken away. And almost never does a person develop a symptom that is worse than the original one had been.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short,  <i class="calibre4"> people do not "need" their symptoms. </i> People develop loveshyness symptoms as a consequence of a <i class="calibre4"> bad fit</i> between (1) inborn temperament, and (2) societal expectations as to what is "proper" and expected behavior for their gender. The mysterious unconscious psychodynamics with which orthodox psychoanalysts waste their time have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with it. The research that has been done clearly indicates that people are <i class="calibre4"> enormously relieved</i> to be rid of their symptoms. The orthodox psychoanalyst wants to give assent to the rights of the "unconscious" over the rights of the rational "conscious"</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind. The behavior therapist and the practice-dating therapist, in stark contrast, want people to govern their lives with the rational, conscious parts of their minds. In essence, they want all people to enjoy free choice and self-determination.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Insight</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many practicing psychotherapists believe that <i class="calibre4"> insight, </i> gradually acquired, into the underlying sources of one's undesired symptoms will progressively cause those symptoms to slowly dissipate and fade away.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p593"></a>562 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, few social scientists would argue that insight is of no value.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, intellectual insight is both interesting and deeply fascinating. It can be counted as one of the major reasons why so many loveshy men had majored in the behavioral and social sciences while they were in college.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem with insight as a therapeutic tool is that it affects only the rational cognition. It impacts only the intellectual part of man. It does virtually nothing about neutralizing or extinguishing anxiety feelings (or the fear of anxiety attacks), or about breaking the bond between severely painful anxiety feelings and a harmless social stimulus, e.g., an attractive girl or woman. In short, intellectual awareness will not even so much as touch the anxiety problem. In order to extinguish anxiety the emotional part of man's mind must be reached and thoroughly impacted upon. And, of course, it is the purpose of all the basic practice-dating exercises to do just that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, practice-dating clients do derive a great deal of intellectual insight about themselves (and the sources of their loveshyness) from fully participating in the various required exercises. However, this insight comes about as an indirect byproduct of participating in the therapy. It is far from being the major therapeutic goal. Loveshy people definitely do not require a great deal of insight in order to get over their symptoms. What they do require is that their heterosexual interaction anxieties be extinguished. Once this severely debilitating anxiety is erased, a person becomes free to develop the social self-confidence and interpersonal finesse that he requires.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Encouraging Dependency and Low Self-Sufficiency</i> A major fear surrounding practice-dating therapy is that practice-dating will operate to encourage an unhealthy dependency. Because this is the most commonplace and also the most destructive criticism (if it is taken seriously), I have commented upon it at various points throughout this book.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To summarize, better than 85 percent of all practice-dating clients go on to find lovers and marriage partners for themselves. In short, they do not <i class="calibre4"> depend</i> on practice-dating therapy to find them a spouse—although they are free to do so if they wish.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But more important is the fact that <i class="calibre4"> dependency is a prerequisite for</i> <i class="calibre4">any kind of true socialization. </i> Loveshy men are quite clearly victims of inadequate socialization. And the <i class="calibre4"> only cure</i> for inadequate socialization <i class="calibre4">is socialization</i>—which necessitates a therapeutic relationship of at least temporary dependency. In order for a person to grow, he/she must go through periods of temporary dependency. In fact, the most mentally</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p594"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 563</p>
<p class="calibre1">healthy, happy people tend to be at least partially emotionally dependent upon certain ego supports (e.g., lovers, spouses, parents, best friends, etc.) throughout their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My many years of studying loveshy men have convinced me that a lack of involvement with social support (friendship) groups lies very close to the heart of the loveshys' problem. In point of fact, very few Americans manage to find their marriage partners strictly on their own without the helpful support of friendship networks in which they are involved. In this respect I think it is quite clear that traditional psychotherapists tend to expect much more (i.e., the unreasonable) from the loveshy, than plain, ordinary non-shy people characteristically deliver.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, most healthy people do sustain some dependency upon friendship support groups. Why shouldn't the loveshy? For the loveshy a good practice-dating therapy group is nothing more than a good social support group very much like "AA" is for alcoholics, and like Parents Anonymous is for child abusers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In short, I believe that most traditional psychotherapists sustain an irrational fear of dependency. Because they do not understand what moderate, healthy dependency upon ego supports is all about, they tend to fear it. We all tend to fear that which we do not understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dependency is a healthy thing unless it is abused.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Loveshy men are indeed well above average on dependency needs, and well below average on some (but not all) forms of self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In terms of having gotten used to living, managing, and traveling on their own, most loveshys probably possess an <i class="calibre4"> above average</i> degree of self-sufficiency. They are below average only in terms of their need for help in the heterosexual interaction aspect of their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the "right" level of dependency may vary from person to person, from woman to woman and from man to man. Rigid requirements and expectations in this area may do more to stifle propitious psychoemotional growth than to promote it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The LoveShys' Need for Structure, and their Fear of Social</i> <i class="calibre4">Ambiguity</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Many orthodox therapists believe in assuming an <i class="calibre4"> "or else" </i> attitude with severely loveshy men. In other words, "either do the homework exercises and confront socially ambiguous situations <i class="calibre4"> or else</i> get the hell out of therapy!" Such therapists believe that "giving in" to the loveshys' fears only serves to reinforce the fears and to slow down their eventual extinction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately, the available research has indicated that "giving in"</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p595"></a>564 THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take too long in getting rid of his symptoms. In fact, the reverse is true! The easier the transition can be made between (1) being loveshy and (2) being non-shy, the better the client will cooperate with the therapeutic regimen, and the sooner he will show very marked improvements. Forcing a person to confront those things he is not yet ready to confront only forces "departure from the field". In other words, the person "escapes" therapy because it is too frightening for him. Such</p>
<p class="calibre1">"therapy" clearly cannot be construed as therapeutic!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Practice-dating is a highly structured therapeutic system. It is a therapeutic approach which removes most of the social ambiguities which loveshy people fear. And this is why moralistic psychotherapists oppose it. However, the acid test is that practice-dating therapy <i class="calibre4"> works</i> for the loveshy, whereas the approaches promoted by moralistic psychotherapists <i class="calibre4"> fail miserably. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "Responsibility" Argument</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Client-centered psychotherapists are especially likely to raise this issue. Personally I am not at all opposed to the philosophy of client-centered therapy. Client-centered therapy (along with participatory democracy) represents a great way to rear healthy, happy, responsible children. For the most effective handling of everyday problems of decision-making, the client-centered approach cannot be beat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, severe loveshyness is <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> an "everyday problem of decision-making"! If a man has clearly demonstrated year after year after painful year that he is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> capable of solving his own problem, then a behavior-oriented approach to therapy (such as practice-dating) must be sought. The client-centered approach in such cases would represent nothing more than an immoral and exasperating waste of time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Client-centered therapists believe that for client-owned problems an approach called "active listening and reflection" yields the best results.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The therapist serves as a sounding board, giving no advice. Using the pronoun "you" ("you-messages"), he simply reflects back to the client the client's message. For example, the client says: "I'm feeling goddam pissed off today"; the therapist reflects back: "You're feeling very upset about something today".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually after an hour or so of client-centered therapy, the client has arrived at some sort of decision or resolution about his problem. He thanks the therapist for the "help", not realizing that the therapist didn't suggest <i class="calibre4"> anything. </i> For people with ordinary, everyday problems, the client-centered approach <i class="calibre4"> does</i> teach responsibility and autonomous self-sufficiency. It teaches each person that he/she does have a tremendous amount of wisdom within, if he/she would only take the time to reflect.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p596"></a>Some Therapeutic Adjuncts 565</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, loveshy men are, if anything, far too introspective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They are always reflecting about something! But the most important issue is that loveshy men simply haven't got the nerve to <i class="calibre4"> follow through</i> on their own decisions once they have come to those decisions. The loveshy know precisely what they want and how to get it. What they lack is the <i class="calibre4"> nerve</i> (freedom from anxiety) to <i class="calibre4"> use</i> their knowledge and to take rational charge of their own lives. Client-centered therapy can be of no help with this. In contrast, practice-dating therapy can work wonders.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The "It's Too Mechanistic" Argument</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like other forms of behavior therapy, practice-dating has been accused of being "too mechanistic". This criticism is especially likely to be voiced by (1) client-centered therapists, (2) gestalt therapists; and (3) humanistic therapists.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Having read through this and the preceding chapter, I doubt whether many readers would agree with the premise that practice-dating therapy is "mechanistic". To be sure, the theory explaining how anxiety is extinguished (i.e., gradually exposing the person in controlled doses to the anxiety-provoking stimulus) is "mechanistic". But the delivery of practice-dating therapy entails <i class="calibre4"> and indeed necessitates</i> a deep and sincere sensitivity to the uniqueness of each client. In fact, a key reason why this form of therapy is as successful as it is, is that it is <i class="calibre4"> more</i> sensitive to idiosyncratic human foibles and weaknesses than most forms of therapy are. Again, the acid test is that the approach <i class="calibre4"> works. </i> Not only does <i class="calibre4">it work, </i> but practice-dating appears to yield <i class="calibre4"> lasting</i> cures.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, MEANINGFUL FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP VERY</p>
<p class="calibre1">EFFECTIVELY BRINGS LOVESHY MEN OUT OF THEIR SHELLS.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Female companionship</i> constitutes a VERY POWERFUL THERAPEUTIC</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">CAUSE; </i> it is <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> merely a therapeutic EFFECT! Simply put, frequent and active heterosexual involvement is the very best psychotherapy for loveshy men. Many therapists convey the impression to their loveshy clients that having a lover is a natural byproduct of having an emotionally healthy personality. This may be true. But it is <i class="calibre4"> at least equally true</i> that having a lover <i class="calibre4"> is itself an important cause</i> for the development of an emotionally healthy, happy personality. As I documented in chapter one, love has been found to galvanize the spirit of even very healthy people, and to cause them to become more effective and successful in <i class="calibre4"> all</i> areas of their lives. The powerful therapeutic impact of being enmeshed in a mutual heterosexual love relationship appears to be as strong <i class="calibre4"> or stronger</i> for the loveshy as it is for the socially successful non-shy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p597"></a>566</p>
<p class="calibre1">THERAPY AND PREVENTION</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">NOTES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Such visualization exercises facilitate the <i class="calibre4"> extinction</i> of anxiety reactions; the subconscious "robot computer" mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is <i class="calibre4">vividly imagined. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Postscript to Chapter 23</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">During the 1983-1985 period, psychiatrists and neurologists together with pharmacologists managed to develop certain drugs which may offer some hope for those suffering from social phobias including loveshyness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These drugs are reputed to effectively prevent a person with a social phobia from experiencing anxiety when he/she is involved in a social encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A genuinely effective drug that would obviate feelings of anxiety might prove useful in two contexts: (1) as a <i class="calibre4"> preventive</i> measure in dealing with withdrawn <i class="calibre4"> prepubescent</i> youngsters and with young adolescents who are just beginning to want to date and to develop cross-sex friendships; and (2) as an <i class="calibre4"> accompanyment</i> to the modes of therapy discussed in this and the preceding chapter—especially practice-dating therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a <i class="calibre4"> sole</i> method of therapy I believe that even highly effective drugs will prove highly unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, even if a severely loveshy man could be <i class="calibre4"> guaranteed</i> that he would not experience any anxiety when in the company of a woman, he would still be forced to deal with the <i class="calibre4"> inertia</i> problem. He would still be forced to get up out of his comfortable chair and risk potentially embarrassing situations. The fear of the unpredictable, of not knowing what to say or how to handle various types of situations, etc., would still operate to keep a loveshy man from entering social contexts on his own wherein there might be some possibility of meeting up with eligible women.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, arranged "matches" through practice-dating therapy together with a coeducational support group composed of fellow shys still represent by far the best hope for solving the problem of severe loveshyness. Using one of these new drugs while on a "practice date"</p>
<p class="calibre1">might well facilitate therapeutic change in the direction of the loveshy man's wishes and desires. The same might also be said for hypnosis—</p>
<p class="calibre1">i.e., for that small minority of loveshys who might be amenable to being placed into a deep trance and given a series of post-hypnotic suggestions (that would help to instigate social action and obviate the experience of anxiety). But drugs by themselves—no matter how good they are—can never conquer social inertia or program a loveshy's mind (like a robot) so that embarrassing or awkward scenes cannot happen.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p598"></a>Chapter 24</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Some Recommendations</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Concerning Prevention</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this chapter is to suggest certain steps that can be taken now that would effectively serve to prevent severe loveshyness from ever developing in the first place. To the extent that loveshyness can be prevented, to that same extent therapeutic measures will become increasingly unnecessary. Unfortunately, we are living in the type of world wherein it can be expected that severe loveshyness will continue to be with us for quite some time into the future. Most people are inclined to be at least somewhat hostile towards the idea of instituting the sort of plans which would effectively reduce the incidence and prevalence of severe loveshyness. Indeed, most preventive schemes tend to be viewed as "radical", and as being just too "far out" to be feasible within the context of our sort of conservative, rugged individualistic, democracy. Nevertheless, to the extent that intelligent, compassionate citizens take steps to institute some of the preventive measures which I shall suggest, to that extent severe loveshyness will become a great deal less widespread than it is today. No one person can effectively provide the society with the sorts of changes that are needed. However, each one of us can do a great deal of good for human happiness by instituting new and creative plans for those children and young people over whom we have personal responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Research on Gene Splicing</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The most potent hope for abolishing severe loveshyness altogether lies in genetic research. We all need to support research on gene splicing with all the money, enthusiasm and moral support that we can muster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I believe that the greatest hope for mankind today lies in the advances which can and will be made over the next 100 years in the field of genetic research.</p>
<p class="calibre1">5 6 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p599"></a>5 6 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the big problem here is that most Americans tend to be quite frightened of genetic research. Again, people tend to fear most strongly (and behave in a most hostile manner toward) those things which they do not understand. I would strongly suggest that scholars working on genetic research need to adamently sustain their convictions and press forward with their work quite irrespective of the tenor of public opinion. A great deal can be done without large financial grants, simply by taking full advantage of university resources and facilities.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Further, there are many private agencies and individuals who are enthusiastically willing to support even the most controversial of genetic research. And such generosity needs to be fully capitalized upon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As I indicated in the chapter titled "Beauty and the LoveShy", the human body is <i class="calibre4"> only the vehicle</i> of the soul and is <i class="calibre4"> not</i> conterminous with the soul. True individuality need rest only within the soul. There is no reason why we should not all "drive" Cadillac, Mercedes, and Rolls Royce "bodies" if we can develop the technology that will enable us to do this. Within a century or so there should be no need for any human being to ever have to die of cancer again, to suffer high blood pressure, or sickle cell anemia, or potentially fatal diseases of the heart, Altzheimer's disease, etc., or to be born nonbeautiful or low on intelligence, to have the depression gene, the schizophrenia gene,  <i class="calibre4"> or the shyness genes\</i> More specifically, within a century it should be possible through the gains that are made on research into gene splicing, to abolish severe loveshyness through abolishing (1) the inhibition gene, (2) the low anxiety threshold gene, and (3) low levels of physical attractiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, such genetic research will most assuredly not result in our all being the same! Instead, it will provide a much better chance than that which currently exists, for the <i class="calibre4"> true uniqueness</i> of each individual soul to manifest itself via the incarnate body. If the inhibition gene is abolished, people can be accorded the <i class="calibre4"> driver's seat</i> of their own lives. They can take charge of their own lives and enjoy the free choice and self-determination which severe shyness obviates. Diseases and malfunctionings of the mind and the body serve to impede the manifestation of man's true uniqueness <i class="calibre4"> and goodness. </i> Rather than taking our individuality and uniqueness away from us, advances in genetic research (e.g., gene splicing, cloning, etc.) will restore these things to us. Such research results will ultimately accord each and every human being the happiness and productivity which he/she deserves.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Bullying</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bullying is a form of child abuse. It differs from what is ordinarily thought of as "child abuse" only in that it victimizes male children only,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p600"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 6 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it is perpetuated by children themselves rather than by parents and other adult figures. The data presented in this book strongly support the premise that a history of chronic victimization by bullies exists in the childhood backgrounds of a very large majority of severely loveshy adults. Thus, bullying causes inhibited boys to fear and to avoid their fellow human beings. It forces inhibited males to grow up as inadequately socialized isolates. And it is my contention that unless and until all forms of bullying behavior are stopped, chronic and severe loveshyness will continue to plague a significant minority of America's male adults. Bullying is a prime cause of lifelong people-phobia in males.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychologist Howard Kaplan's work on aggression has revealed that arbitrary and capricious victimization by aggression is much more likely if the victimized individual is perceived by the perpetrator as being either unable and/or unwilling to retaliate. Pre-love-shy elementary school boys develop a reputation very early in life for being both unwilling and unable to fight back and to defend themselves. The large majority of the loveshy men studied for this book had been pacifists (both ideologically <i class="calibre4"> and</i> out of fear) throughout the entirety of their formative years.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover, any suggestion that they ought to take lessons on learning how to defend themselves had been reacted to by these men as constituting a form of cruel discrimination against the male sex—inasmuch as girls are never told that they must learn how to defend themselves against physical forms of abuse. To phrase the question quite directly, why indeed should pacifists be constrained to give up being pacifists?</p>
<p class="calibre1">In a supposedly free society, why shouldn't a male child have a <i class="calibre4"> right</i> (1) to remain a pacifist, and (2) to remain free from both physical and psychological harassment and persecution by bullies?!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to now American educators and community leaders have approached the problem of bullying with an incredibly permissive set of attitudes. Many people assume the validity of such cliches as "boys will be boys" and "all male children are naturally cruel;" and that all little boys had better learn to defend themselves. Many educators believe that since chronic bullies come from problem families, it is best to deal with the child bully as more of a victim of circumstances himself than as a creator of what is often a lifetime of unhappy circumstances for the quiet, fearful and pacifistic boys upon whom he picks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The past several decades of anthropological research have proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that all male children are <i class="calibre4"> NOT</i> "naturally cruel". Indeed, there are scores of societies all over the world wherein violent, highly aggressive contact play among male children is simply nonexistent. The large number of bullying-prone children in the United States at <i class="calibre4"> all</i> socioeconomic levels is a natural byproduct of our culturally based tendency to aggressively encourage our children to compete vis-a-vis each other in all things instead of to cooperate. It is also caused</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p601"></a>5 7 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the way we glorify and glamorize football both in the mass media as well as in our schools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A problematical home life can and does function to increase the chances that a particular child will gravitate towards finding satisfaction in hazing and bullying other children. But a problematical home life is never a sufficient cause by itself to assure that a child will bully and harass others. Indeed, most male children who come from disturbing or less-than-happy homes do <i class="calibre4"> not</i> bully or haze others. In all probability most bullies doubtless possess the <i class="calibre4"> choleric</i> sort of inborn temperament (see page 00).</p>
<p class="calibre1">In criminology today there is an increasing and much welcomed trend towards the assuring and protecting of the <i class="calibre4"> victim's rights . </i> Bullies cause emotional scars and ruin lives by creating "people-phobes" and social isolates. Moreover, in not being swiftly, consistently, and severely punished for their mindless cruelty, bullies' tendencies to treat their fellow human beings as <i class="calibre4"> things</i> (without feelings, or with feelings that do not count) <i class="calibre4"> rather than as people, </i> are strongly reinforced and rewarded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be sure, "swift and severe punishment" must <i class="calibre4"> NEVER</i> under <i class="calibre4">ANY</i> circumstances entail corporal punishment. Actions speak louder than words, and corporal punishment has been shown in study after study to teach violence as a normal response to frustration, and to promote violence, bullying, and other forms of physical aggression. In essence, corporal punishment is itself a <i class="calibre4"> prime cause</i> of bullying. The upshot of the best research that has come out of the social sciences in recent years is that WE MUST TEACH PARENTS AND TEACHERS</p>
<p class="calibre1">NEVER TO USE PHYSICAL FORMS OF DISCIPLINE AT ANY TIME</p>
<p class="calibre1">OR FOR ANY REASON.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I would recommend immediate suspension from school for any and all bullying behavior. Such action should be taken with respect to bullies of <i class="calibre4"> ALL</i> age levels from kindergarten through the twelfth grade.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each suspension should be for a minimum of at least one full day. Serious and chronic violators should be suspended for two and three days or even a week for each offense. Furthermore, all boys who have lost more than five days of school within a year's time for bullying their age-mates, should be placed in special schools. I believe there is a serious price to be paid for America's insistence upon educating all kinds of personalities in the same classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I strongly oppose all forms of racial and sexual segregation. But as an educator I <i class="calibre4"> very strongly support</i> segregation of elementary school aged children on the basis of <i class="calibre4"> native temperament. </i> Highly aggressive, bullying-prone male children <i class="calibre4"> must not</i> take classes in the same classroom or play on the same playgrounds as naturally inhibited, low anxiety threshold male children. Wolves are not kept in the same pen as lambs, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p602"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 7 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chihuahuas and Miniature Poodles are not housed with Dobermans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most shy children do not need to be educated exclusively with other shy children. But they certainly must not be made to regularly interface with those whose native temperaments are poles apart from their own, and whose very presence represents noxious stimuli.4</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">The Perils of Competition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Anthropologists have documented the fact that bullying among male children is almost unknown in societies that do not glorify competition. With proper safeguards, competition can bring the best out of people, and can assure high quality products and services. In stark contrast, competition involving <i class="calibre4"> physical</i> activities almost always invites and causes a very great deal of conflict and wastage of human resources.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, competition is far less effective than cooperation at inspiring mutually gratifying interaction and friendly sociability. Indeed, competition (especially in physical activities) is almost always antithetical to effective cooperation and to the ability of people to work together peacefully, harmoniously and productively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is important to note that many persons simply withdraw from competition whenever they lose too regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"In singing the praises of competition, many people overlook the important fact that although competition stimulates those who win fairly often, it discourages those who nearly always lose. The slow learner in the classroom, the athletic dub on the playground,  <i class="calibre4"> the</i> <i class="calibre4">adolescent who fails to draw the interest of the opposite sex</i> (italics mine)—</p>
<p class="calibre1">such persons usually quit trying, for the pain of repeated failure becomes unendurable. They withdraw from competition in these areas, having decided that the activity isn't worthwhile. There is even experimental evidence that repeated failures not only dampen one's willingness to compete, but may even impair one's actual ability to compete  . . . . It appears that repeated failures will fill people with such a sense of incompetence and such an overwhelming expectation of failure that they are unable to use their abilities to good advantage. Success or failure becomes self-perpetuating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is ample experimental evidence that feelings of self-confidence and expectations of success will improve performance . . . Even the expectations of other people have been found to affect one's ability to perform well  . . . . It is not surprising that repeated failures destroy both the willingness and the ability to compete. It may be that for every genius whom competition has stimulated to great achievement, there are a hundred or a thousand shiftless failures whom competition has demoralized  . . . . Competition seems to be stimulating only in some kinds of activity. Where the task is simple and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p603"></a>572 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">routeine, competition is followed by the greatest gains in output.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the task becomes more intricate and the quality of work more important, competition is less helpful  . . . . Indeed, competition often degenerates into conflict and harassment." (Horton, Paul B., and Chester L. Hunt 4th Edition, 1976, p. 296)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">A Non-Punitive Antidote for Bullying</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sociologist Urie Bronfenbrenner (1970) has done some extensive researching of the Soviet system of education. In his studies of a large number of elementary schools in the Ukraine, he took full advantage of many opportunities to observe children engaged in spontaneous play.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And he noted that there was never any bullying or rough horse play of the sort which is so commonplace here in the United States. He further learned that any sort of peer bullying is very much against Russian norms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian schools foster upon their pupils a very interesting social arrangement from which we here in America could stand to learn a very great deal. To be sure, Russia is doubtless a far less desirable country for lifetime residence than is the United States. Nevertheless, there are a good many things which we could do well to learn from the Russians—</p>
<p class="calibre1">just as there are a great many things which they would do well to learn from us. Lately most educated Americans have recognized the benefits of learning certain business philosophies and approaches from the Jap-anese. There is not a person or a group alive from whom we could not learn something—and derive substantial benefits as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Beginning with the fourth grade (9-year olds), every child is assigned to another child of his/her own gender, who is <i class="calibre4"> three years younger</i> than he/she is. Thus, every child from the fourth grade through the twelfth grade is assigned to and is responsible for a charge. If that charge falls behind in his/her school work, the elder child is viewed as responsible, and that elder child (along with his/her entire classroom) loses valued points. Similarly, if someone's younger child is mistreated or teased, it is considered the hard, fast responsibility of the child three years his senior to stop the teasing and to do the necessary protecting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most Russian children spend a great deal of their after-school play-time with the child three years younger than themselves to whom they had been assigned. They engage in a great deal of recreation with this child, they instruct and tutor him/her in both academic and social skills, and they are extremely protective in a fatherly or motherly way towards that child. Moreover, they revel in their charge's every victory and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p604"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 7 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment. When the younger child successfully masters some learning task with which he/she had been experiencing difficulty, the older "big brother" or "big sister" very often enjoys the victory even more than the younger child himself/herself does.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with obviating the sort of bullying and hazing which prevails in almost all elementary schools here in the United States, Bronfenbrenner asserts that this pairing up of older child with younger child teaches <i class="calibre4"> (through the actual living of roles)</i> a great deal about social responsibility and compassion. For example, the age-grade groupings which dominate life here in the United States are largely unknown in the Soviet Union. Children of all ages have ample opportunities for enjoying interaction with and getting to know and appreciate people of all ages,  <i class="calibre4"> including the elderly. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In a highly competitive society such as our own, the virtue of compassion is seldom taught. The rewards and benefits of compassion are typically lost sight of by adults in their unabashed quest for ego aggrandizement. And as a result, valuable human resources are lost or sacrificed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As Bronfenbrenner's work made clear, there <i class="calibre4"> is</i> competition in the Soviet Union. But it is invariably a matter of groups of people competing against groups of people, rather than having individuals compete against individuals, as we do here in the United States. The advantage of group-based competition is that children learn early in life to care about the propitious growth and development of other people besides just themselves. In a painless and often enjoyable way, they learn to want to help one another instead of bullying and harassing individuals who are less competitive or less competent than they are. Simply put, Russian children are taught to care about their age-mates, and especially about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">"charge" three years younger than they, to whom each Soviet child is assigned and for whom they are responsible.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems to me that peer group avoidance and quite possibly loveshyness itself could be almost totally prevented through the adopting of a plan similar to the foregoing. Indeed, such a plan could be extended to include all people in society up to the age of 25. Hence, each 25-year old would be assigned to a college or university senior; and each university senior would be assigned to a university freshman; and each university freshman would be assigned to a high school sophomore, <i class="calibre4">etc.</i> With this sort of benign regimen, cases of incipient long-term loveshyness could be nipped in the bud. Every young man and women in college and in high school would have ample opportunities for dating members of the opposite sex because every high school and college student's "big brother" or "big sister" would see to it that he/she did—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p605"></a>5 7 4 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that he/she was actively involved in gaining the necessary social self-confidence and interpersonal finesse vis-a-vis the opposite sex for effective adjustment throughout adult life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lest the reader suspect that this sort of regimen might undermine academic mastery, it should be stated in no uncertain terms that Russian students at all education levels tend to be much more serious and much more accomplished than their American counterparts. For example, chronic cases of underachievement and truancy are very seldom seen in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In sum, bullying and hazing, and quite possibly loveshyness itself, can be prevented through assigning every child to a "big brother" or</p>
<p class="calibre1">"big sister" three years his/her senior. Besides enabling children to achieve better grades in school, such a procedure could well eliminate pathological shyness through helping children in an enjoyable and benign way to develop strong interpersonal skills and social self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">The Cruelest Bully of All</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mindless patriotism and religious fundamentalism can and do inspire bullying as well as a host of other forms of violence. What happened in Vietnam, in Jonestown, Guyana, and during the Nazi Holocaust, etc., along with what is currently happening in Iran, well illustrates this point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout the history of man, patriotism and religious fundamentalism have both been responsible for the cruelest, most mindless, and most relentless forms of bullying. Politically and religiously conservative people have often been characterized by a highly uncompassionate intolerance for any kind of weakness, and by an ideology which often views the victim as fully responsible for his plight. It is therefore not surprising that loveshy men tend to have little sympathy for the viewpoints of conservative political and religious officials. Indeed, loveshy men endeavor to avoid the clutches of such officials at all costs. And this is reflected in their attitudes toward the draft and towards the military establishment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is also reflected in their attitudes toward patriotism generally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patriotism is a form of mindless, uncritical <i class="calibre4"> "groupthink". </i> Children from kindergarten age onward are required to stand and recite the flag salute every morning until the day they graduate high school. They are encouraged to develop feelings of uncritical emotionalism surrounding the idea of "love of country", and to associate political directives <i class="calibre4"> (whatever</i> these might be) with highly charged emotional feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p606"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention 575</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Iran this <i class="calibre4"> patriotic "groupthink" </i> is reflected in the mindless chanting of such slogans as "death to America" which young people of all ages are required to do. It is similarly reflected in the zealous chanting of "Jesus this" and "Jesus that" by various fundamentalistic religious groups, and in the group violence that went on in Germany during the Nazi era.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abundant examples of similarly intolerant and highly uncompassionate groupthink occurred in the United States during the Vietnam War era. For example, James Mitchner pointed out in his book on the KENT STATE tragedy (wherein four students were shot by the National Guard in 1970) that almost half of the locals believed that the students</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"deserved to die" </i> for their part in protesting the war, and that "more of them should be shot".</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some examples of how the groupthink of mindless patriotism can and does cause the most heinous and extremely cruel manifestations of bullying can be seen in how draft resisters were treated in the United States during the Civil War and during World War I. Then as during the Vietnam era there was a tremendous amount of bullying of pacifists which was done in the name of patriotism—as though patriotism justifies cruelty against those who are temperamentally and/or morally incapable of handling either the giving or the taking of extreme forms of physical aggression. However, the level of overt cruelty during these earlier times was far worse than that which prevailed during the worst of the Vietnam years. For example, hundreds of pacifist-oriented young men were incarcerated, tortured, and murdered in prison by guards and by other prisoners. And many other pacifists were tortured and murdered before anyone had ever even arrested them or charged them with draft evasion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In essence, those least capable from a psychoemotional standpoint of defending themselves have always received the most bullying and cruelty from sadistic individuals. And down through human history a very great deal of this cruelty has been wrought in the name and interest of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"patriotism". </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Given their lifelong feminine interest patterns and penchants, it is not surprising that most loveshy men sustain very hostile attitudes toward both the draft and the military. In fact, many of them casually refer to the draft as "selective slavery", and almost all of them speak bitterly and disparagingly about a political establishment that could permit a system of conscription to exist which "forces young men to become dispensable pawns" and which insists upon spending 40 or more percent of all tax dollars on the accutraments of military defense.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet <i class="calibre4"> all</i> of the older loveshys had managed to successfully find ways of keeping out of the military. Specifically, 62 percent had obtained either a psychiatric "4-F" or a "1-Y"; and a surprisingly high 31 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p607"></a>5 7 6 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">had successfully gotten away with never having registered. This is especially interesting as many of these 35 to 50-year old men had grown up during the Vietnam War era. The remaining 7 percent had had "1-A"</p>
<p class="calibre1">or "2-S" classifications, and had never been called. This latter group had fantasies about pursuing "conscientious objector" status if they were called. (Parenthetically, almost a third of the psychiatric "4-Fs" were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">"homosexual</i> 4-Fs"; thus, these men had feigned homosexuality vis-a-vis the required two psychiatrists so that they could be assured of never having to have anything to do with the military.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many Americans perceive attitudes such as these as "unAmerican".</p>
<p class="calibre1">But as one loveshy man pointed out, the government provides little or no choice of service activity to the young men it conscripts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shit, I don't have any objection to the idea of being of service to my country during a time of real and genuine crisis. What I could not accept for myself was the possibility of being placed in a situation that I know I could never adjust to—not even in the remotest way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since I was a very young kid I've avoided all contact sports and anything aggressive. I knew there was no way I could ever be of service to anybody in any kind of combat capacity. If the government had some way of assuring people like me of clerical jobs and of no basic training of any physical kind, I would have no objection to entering the service. I mean they guarantee women those kinds of jobs. Even in World War II they didn't force women to fight. I mean, they put them in different kinds of clerical jobs. Well, I don't fee) that I'm any different from any woman that way. I could never be of service in combat because it's against my nature to have anything to do with aggression. And it's always been that way for me. But I'm sure there are lots of things I could do well that would be of help—just so long as they didn't require me to live in the same building with a bunch of guys who would bother and annoy me."</p>
<p class="calibre1">(35-year old loveshy man.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the government has a tendency to want to <i class="calibre4"> force square pegs</i> <i class="calibre4">into round holes. </i> It operates under a set of untested assumptions concerning what "men" are like and about what their capacities are. And just as not all boys fit the junior high school physical education teacher's preconceptions about what all 12 to 15 year old boys are like or should be like, it is similarly true that not all 19-24 year olds can or do fit the government's notions of what a "man" in that age group should be like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forcing square pegs into round holes can prove dangerous to more than just one person. The presence of a shell-shock-prone soldier in a fighting unit can easily cause the mortal endangerment of all the other men in his battalion. In addition to the necessity of coping with their severe fearfulness and hypervigilance (and this may be impossible given</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p608"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 7 7</p>
<p class="calibre1">their earlier tendency to run away from any involvement in touch football!), loveshy males are not used to cooperative interaction. As the data of this book have demonstrated, most loveshys grow up as friendless isolates. Unlike shy girls, most severely shy boys experience few if any friendships during the course of their formative years. An effective combat unit must necessarily be dependent upon a "group mind", and upon a deep and abiding sense of group loyalty. Severe fearfulness and daydream-proneness will block this from happening in a combat unit just as surely as it will obviate effective team spirit among a group of 14-year olds put together for touch football by a physical education teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The shy, inhibited, football-hating 14-year old with feminine interest patterns will behave in a football context just like the proverbial</p>
<p class="calibre1">"duck out of water". And he may unintentionally sabotage his so-called</p>
<p class="calibre1">"team's" efforts and game plan. The same applies to the using of a highly fearful, socially avoidant person in a combat situation. The net result could very well prove catastrophic! Thus, any rigid insistence that all types of personalities owning male bodies must "serve" in combat could seriously undermine military effectiveness and needlessly cause the loss of many lives.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Simply put, the loveshy would constitute a serious <i class="calibre4"> liability</i> in any combat situation. Their innate fearfulness and shell-shock-prone dispositions could easily cause the lives of their fellow soldiers to be needlessly endangered. As the shy and inhibited naturally avoid anxiety-provoking situations (instead of fighting or confronting them), there is no logical way their presence in a military context could be viewed as representing an <i class="calibre4"> "asset". </i> Loveshy men are not emotionally capable of physically defending anybody or anything. They are men who had simply not been born with the tools that are indispensable for fighting and killing. Even among successful sportsmen, there are some people who cannot function rationally under conditions of extreme stress, and who could never bring themselves to kill. With the loveshy, either the giving or the taking of such aggression would be a total impossibility. Emotionally sensitive cowards could never, in all common sense, be expected to make a constructive contribution on the combat battlefield.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, combat experience would doubtless be the worst conceivable thing for a loveshy person's mental health and eventual chances for stability. To be sure, this statement doubtless holds validity for the majority of different kinds of personalities.  <i class="calibre4"> Combat is extremely bad for</i> <i class="calibre4">mental health, </i> period! And the many psychiatric "basket cases" to accrue from combat exercises in the Vietnam War represent ample testimony to that fact. But on the basis of all the data presented and discussed in this book, it would appear to be <i class="calibre4"> especially</i> true for the inhibited, severely loveshy person.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p609"></a>5 7 8 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram has collected some very fascinating data that are particularly germane to the issue of forcing all manner of male personalities into combat situations. In his celebrated study of obedience to authority, Milgram found women to be as likely as men to obey authority when such obedience required the severe hurting of another human being. However, the women took a much, much longer period of time than the men to obey this authority. They hemmed and hawed, perspired and vehemently protested before engaging in the required cruelty. They suffered a great deal more than the men did before engaging in the cruel action. However, the key point is that they were ultimately responsible for as much aggressive cruelty vis-a-vis their victims as were the men. They were merely much slower and far less efficient in the delivery of this cruelty.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the data presented in this book clearly document, loveshy males are temperamentally very much like women. Indeed, their biologically based temperament appears to be far more similar to that which is typical for women than it is to what is typical for men. The net conclusion, of course, is that all of the reasons usually cited for keeping women out of combat situations are at the very least <i class="calibre4"> equally applicable</i> to loveshy men, or to any men with inborn inhibition and low inborn anxiety thresholds. If such men would shoot to kill at all, they could be predicted from Milgram's data to take much longer to respond than</p>
<p class="calibre1">"normal" men, thus endangering their own lives as well as the lives of their peers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today with the reinstitution of draft registration we see the United States Government spending many millions of the taxpayers' dollars on trying to seek out and enforce the cooperation of what are probably <i class="calibre4"> the</i> <i class="calibre4">very least appropriate</i> sorts of personalities for potential combat situations!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, they are probably the least appropriate sort of personalities for <i class="calibre4">any</i> type of military activity that purports to prove effective. In this sense, the frenetic effort to "force square pegs into round holes" can only lead to a host of socially deleterious, counterproductive consequences. Thus, the military is doubtless the only sort of employer <i class="calibre4"> in existence</i> that spends vastly more money for the recruitment of the <i class="calibre4"> very least appropriate job</i> <i class="calibre4">candidates</i> than it does upon the recruitment of the <i class="calibre4"> most</i> suitably qualified and appropriate ones!</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the basis of the findings reported in this book, there are several obvious steps which the government could take to assure that men with inappropriate native temperaments for military activity are screened out.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of this "screening" is now being done on a self-initiated basis as is witnessed by the large number of "4-Fs" among the sample of older loveshys studied for this book. However, some additional steps that the government could and should take include the following:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p610"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 7 9</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. Exclude anyone who can document a fear of and an unwillingness to partake in any contact sports throughout the formative years of childhood and adolescence. It is most unlikely that any</p>
<p class="calibre1">"goldbricking" could occur here because most boys find great joy in contact sports, and meet (as well as keep) most of their closest friends through such participation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. Exclude anyone who has not had the experience of being an integral part of a network of friends. Again, it seems very unlikely that anyone would "fake" this as for most people it is quite painful not to have friends.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. Exclude anyone whose interest patterns do not include any of the traditionally prescribed male participant/spectator sports of football, basketball, baseball, hockey, rugged calesthenics, etc., or rock music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">4. Exclude any man whose native temperament places him high up in the melancholic quadrant of the Eysenck Cross (see Figure 1, page 41).</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, under conditions of all-out war, men who are "doubtful"</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be conscripted for non-combat duties. On the other hand, men with any or all of the four above characteristics could and should be left out entirely from the military without in any way endangering an efficient and effective national defense.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre4">Cowardice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The term "coward" has been applied to people throughout history in a very derogatory and disparaging manner. The implicit assumption, of course, is that these people <i class="calibre4"> choose</i> to be the way they are. And because of that they should be punished and/or treated as morally inferior.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First we need to note that <i class="calibre4"> female</i> human beings are <i class="calibre4"> almost NEVER</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">labeled "cowards"; and they are certainly never punished for being part of this noncomformist category. Secondly, the evidence presented in this book strongly suggests that cowardice is to a far greater extent a function of inborn temperament than it is of gender. People do not and cannot select the temperament with which they are born, anymore than they can select the color of skin or the relative degree of handsomeness or beauty with which they will be born.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The upshot is that punishing cowardice is tantamount to punishing an inborn, native trait or characteristic such as that of race or sex, over which an individual has no control. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to agree that this is <i class="calibre4"> immoral. </i> You cannot reduce the prevalence of black people by punishing black people. You cannot reduce</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p611"></a>5 8 0 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">the prevalence of homosexuality by punishing homosexuals. And similarly, you cannot reduce the prevalence of cowardice by punishing those who possess that inborn characteristic. And, of course, the same applies to loveshyness as well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, punishing cowardice can never help to win wars or to effect any other constructive accomplishment. Indeed, we might even do well to recognize that cowardice may even have its positive side: If by some magical quirk everyone on the face of the earth could suddenly be turned into a coward, there would be no such thing as war, and all the taxpayers'</p>
<p class="calibre1">monies throughout the world could be freed at last to create a better life and world for everyone!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, inasmuch as cowardice does appear to be inborn, it can be assumed that the incidence of <i class="calibre4"> true</i> cowardice is the same in all countries.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, America doubtless possesses no higher a percent of true cowards than any other country. And this represents a prime reason as to why American can well afford to be kind and compassionate towards its cowards. Again, punishing the phenonmenon will never serve to reduce its incidence!1</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corporal Punishment Needs to be Outlawed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Many of the loveshys had been frequently traumatized as children as a result of the corporal punishment that they had received from their parents. In addition, the bullies who had so frequently victimized the loveshys had also (according to the best available data on child bullies) received a great deal of corporal punishment at the hands of their parents. As per my discussion in Chapter 8, a huge amount of empirical research evidence overwhelmingly contraindicates <i class="calibre4"> any</i> use of physical punishment upon human beings. Simply put, we know as <i class="calibre4"> fact</i> that corporal punishment gives rise to a large host of very deleterious consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly, I would recommend getting laws passed at the federal, state and local levels which clearly prohibit any use at all of corporal punishment in the private home and in the school. (A teacher defending himself/herself vis-a-vis a delinquent youth would not be considered guilty of violating the law.) Sweden passed such a law in 1979. And in their nation of some 8.5 million inhabitants, their law seems to be working out quite well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We must get over the idea that parents "own" their children. No human being can ever "own" another. It is definitely counterproductive for any society to allow the private home to be so "private" that within</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p612"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 8 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">its confines parents can be permitted to screw up the minds and lives of their children. Society has a vested interest in the propitious growth and development of <i class="calibre4"> all</i> its children. And child-rearing philosophies and approaches which are <i class="calibre4"> known</i> to contribute to undesirable outcomes cannot reasonably be considered justifiable or permissible simply because</p>
<p class="calibre1">"a man's home is his castle"!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such a law against corporal punishment could be assiduously enforced merely by frequently (e.g., daily) reminding children at school of its existence and of its importance from the standpoint of their welfare.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Very few violators of this law would ever be either jailed or fined as a penalty for its violation. Instead, it would be made clear to both parents and children alike that the penalties would be essentially three-fold, and would, in time, serve to drastically upgrade the quality of American family life:</p>
<p class="calibre1">1. All violators would be required to take (and attend regularly) an intensive 20-week "Parent-Effectiveness Training" seminar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Such seminars were founded in the 1960s by Dr. Thomas Gordon, and are based upon his books titled PARENT-EFFECTIVENESS TRAINING, P.E.T. IN ACTION, TEACHER—</p>
<p class="calibre1">EFFECTIVENESS TRAINING, and LEADERSHIP EFFECTIVENESS TRAINING. The Gordon approach has been found to give rise to far better results than any other method. It is an approach rooted in the principles of participatory democracy; and in it the needs and feelings of <i class="calibre4"> both</i> parents <i class="calibre4"> and</i> child are respected. Some parents might well require a repeated exposure to these seminars, whereas others might satisfactorily master the techniques after having learned them once. The "ONE MINUTE FATHER"</p>
<p class="calibre1">and "ONE MINUTE MOTHER" works of Dr. Spencer Johnson (1983) should also be integrated into these seminars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">2. All violators would be required to join a "Parents Anonymous"</p>
<p class="calibre1">support group (composed of other parents who have also been found guilty of "spanking" their children) which would meet twice per week for one hour each time. This lay group would act to support "P.E.T." goals and methods; each member would be helped in a whole host of ways by fellow parents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">3. All violators would be visited on a regular basis by a social worker who is highly trained in methods of effective parenting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He/she would be charged with the responsibility of tactfully teaching parents quality child-rearing methods. The social worker would also be responsible for following up each family to make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p613"></a>5 8 2 THE RESEARCH STUDY AND THE DATA IT UNCOVERED</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure that there is no reversion to corporal punishment or to any other form of psychoemotionally abusive parenting.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Some Recommendations Concerning Dogs</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Most loveshy men seem to have an unusually strong affinity for dogs. They very much like them, and they interact with them far better and more successfully than they do with human beings. I believe that this special penchant can and should be capitalized upon in both therapeutic and preventive efforts with regard to loveshyness. And I would like to offer two suggestions in this regard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, instead of banning dogs from dormitories and other campus facilities, university administrators should establish a kennel on each campus under their care. All students found through testing to be shy and/or lonely and/or depressed would be encouraged to take advantage of kennel programs and facilities, although such facilities would be open and freely available to all interested students.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon going away to college each interested student could either bring his/her dog with him/her; or he/she could purchase one of his/her preferred breed at the kennel. Dogs could be kept either at the kennel, or they could be housed inside of the regular student housing. In the latter case, each dog owner would have another dog owner as a room mate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through the operation of such university-based kennels, loveshy students would be accorded an excellent opportunity for meeting and interacting with opposite-sexed people of similar interests. Special programs could be instituted that require dog owners to work together and to cooperate with each other. Earlier in this book I introduced the concept of "  <i class="calibre4">superordinate goals". </i> Simply put, when a boy and a girl have to work together in order to successfully attain some mutually desired goal, they grow closer together both socially and emotionally. Thus, they are forced in a very pleasant, benevolent way to interact with each other for the attainment of their mutually desired goal. And as a result they both grow in terms of interpersonal skills and social self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a fairly well known fact that dogs represent an excellent way for people of opposite sexes to meet each other.2 Given the penchant that the loveshy have for dogs, I believe that this presents a therapeutic modus operandi that should be capitalized upon. Today virtually hundreds of psychotherapists are very successfully treating people (especially children and the elderly) through dog-oriented psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dogs are enormously valuable therapeutic aids and growth facilitators.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p614"></a>Some Recommendations Concerning Prevention  5 8 3</p>
<p class="calibre1">And their value in treating loveshy, lonely and depressed people for too long now has remained ignored and neglected.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My second suggestion is that we need to launch the development of singles' apartment buildings containing appropriately staffed kennels.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most loveshy people would very much like to own a dog. But many of them feel that they cannot do so (1) because it is often very difficult for a person of limited funds to locate an apartment building where dogs are permitted, and (2) because most loveshys have to work and/or attend school, and the dog would have to be left alone all day.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are already a good many singles apartment complexes around.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, most of these cater to the extroverted, outgoing, financially well-off individual who is able to pretty much take care of his/her own needs. And none of the singles apartment complexes that I have heard about contain dog kennels.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems to me that a great selling point for the renting of furnished apartments for singles would be something like the following: "This apartment building caters to unmarried dog lovers of both sexes. You don't have to worry about having to leave your dog alone in your apartment all day long while you are at work or on vacation. In lieu of a swimming pool, our entire central courtyard is given over to a professionally staffed and supervised dog kennel. When you go to work in the morning you simply drop your dog behind the appropriate dog fence, and he/she will have plenty of canine companionship as well as room to romp and play all day long. When you come home from work you simply pick up your dog and take him/her to your apartment with you. We have three large doggie playgrounds: one for large dogs, one for medium-sized dogs, and one for small dogs. All dogs are welcomed excepting attack-trained animals of the German Shepherd, Doberman, Rottweiler genre. We merely require proof of spaying, neutering, and of anti-rabies and distemper inoculations."</p>
